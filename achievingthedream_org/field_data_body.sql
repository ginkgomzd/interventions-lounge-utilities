Other stakeholders with influence on student success (K-12 systems, community groups, employers, etc.) are included in discussions about student performance, desired outcomes, and potential improvement strategies.

This analysis explores students&rsquo; first-term academic achievement, and those who returned for a second academic term. Students from all Achieving the Dream cohorts and colleges were included in this analysis, and the data was disaggregated by race/ethnicity, Pell receipt, gender, age, major field of student, attendance and developmental referral status. The analysis indicates that age and first-term attendance status are significantly related to both first-term achievement and second-term persistence. Older students and those attending less than half-time were more likely to be first-term achievers, but they were also less likely to persist to the second term. These results emphasize the need to disaggregate student data to refine what seems like an obvious relationship between achievement, measured here by grades, first-term completion, and second-term persistence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>','','filtered_html');

Increasing the number of students who attempt gateway classes is important in terms of student persistence and credential completion. And, the percentage of students who succeed when attempting gateway classes (the completions ratio) needs attention. At best, failure to successfully complete these classes slows progress toward graduation or transfer. At worst, it may trigger the decision to drop out. This analysis investigates the number of attempts it takes students to complete gateway coursework, to determine if there are identifiable characteristics associated with students who pass these classes on the first attempt as compared to those who attempt the coursework multiple times.

This issue of Data Notes examines the demographic and background characteristics of students who completed certificates or degrees, or transferred within three years of initial enrollment.

The results suggest that state context is an important consideration in understanding what contributes to student success.&nbsp;More students in states that historically have larger proportions of low-income residents receive federal aid than do those students in states with lower proportions of low-income residents. State and local support of colleges is another factor in providing the resources necessary to educate students, with appropriations per FTE ranging from a high of $11,314 to a low of $3,507. On average, 57 percent of entering students were referred to developmental education, with a state percentages ranging from 75 percent to 47 percent of students. Overall, seven percent of students referred to developmental English successfully completed gateway English within two years of enrolling, compared with five percent of students referred to developmental math.

The data show that FYPs who started college full-time had higher second-year persistence rates than those who started part-time, as did students who were referred to developmental education or were enrolled in terminal majors. To determine the cumulative effect of various student characteristics on student outcomes, data reflecting FYPs were first disaggregated by enrollment status, followed by developmental education referral, major field, and then Pell grant receipt.

INSERT INTO `field_data_body` VALUES ('node','news',0,1316,2971,'und',0,'<p>As Drew Ramsey reflects on how he got where he is today, he has a message to share: set goals, follow your dream, work hard, accept help, and don&rsquo;t let a little thing like a serious car accident derail you.</p><p>Now just 22 years old and a K &amp; N Pro Series East Official with NASCAR, Ramsey claims he was &ldquo;born racing.&rdquo; With an uncle and cousin who raced, he always wanted to be behind the wheel. As an adolescent, he and his dad started go-kart racing just for fun, and it soon morphed into competition.</p><p>&ldquo;While other kids were hanging out at the mall, I was getting dirty behind the wheel of a go-kart,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>At age 12, he was advised by his father that if he wanted to continue, he would have to get his own sponsors. He did that by approaching family and friends and one day on a return trip from the WKA (World Karting Association) World Nationals in Daytona, he hit pay dirt. On the plane, a stranger noticed his WKA ball cap and struck up a conversation with Ramsey and his father. This stranger soon became a benefactor and over time supplied tires, a chassis, and even an engine to the young driver. As Ramsey says, he was &ldquo;beatin&rsquo; and bangin&rsquo; on a go-kart track&rdquo; before he earned his drivers&rsquo; license.</p><p>Graduating from go-kart to race car, Ramsey logged some time in 2008 and 2009 as a crew member with Taylor Brothers Motorsports out of Madison, Virginia. In that job he worked with tires, race car preparation and repair in the shop, and other common race track duties.</p><p>But racing is extremely competitive, and Ramsey opted next to enroll in general education courses with an eye to go into the emergency medical services program at Central Virginia Community College (CVCC). Recognizing that his heart was really on the track instead of the in back of an ambulance, Ramsey gave up his seat in the paramedic classroom and instead enrolled at the University of Northwestern Ohio in the High Performance Engine program.</p><p>Unused to the frigid temperatures and all the snow, Ramsey soon discovered that he would have to take regular mechanic classes for one year before he was ever allowed to touch a race car. That&rsquo;s when a family friend said, &ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t you at Patrick Henry Community College in Martinsville? They work on NASCAR late models and are right beside a truck series team. That&rsquo;s where you need to be.&rdquo;</p><p>After learning about PHCC&rsquo;s pull-down rig, shock dynameters and telemetry system, Ramsey determined that PHCC was where he could learn more about the technical set-up aspect of the race car and expand his knowledge. He enrolled in PHCC&rsquo;s motorsports program in fall 2009, and because his instructor Talmage Thomas knew about his past experience with Taylor Brothers, he was turning wrenches on a brand new race car on his first day.</p><p>In the second year of the program, students study under Lou Larosa, known in racing circles for his work as engine builder for Dale Earnhardt and Kale Yarborough. Racing engines were new to Ramsey, and he would come out of class each night with a headache. Larosa made the students think so much they would be &ldquo;steaming,&rdquo; Ramsey said, but he is proud to be able to say that Lou Larosa taught him everything he knows about a racing engine.</p><p>Just as he was getting a good start in the program, Ramsey &ndash; who had always wanted to be behind the wheel -- fell asleep behind it. On his way to class in his second semester, Ramsey woke up sitting in the middle of the road. He was airlifted out and en route to the hospital couldn&rsquo;t help but worry: &ldquo;Will I walk again? Live? My dream is shattered.&rdquo;</p><p>It turned out that his physical injuries were not as serious as he feared, although they did keep him bedridden and wheelchair-bound for some time. What didn&rsquo;t happen was the loss of classroom time, thanks to Thomas, who showed up at Ramsey&rsquo;s bedside to give him lesson plans he could work on from home.</p><p>&ldquo;He kept saying, when are you coming back? We want ya, we need ya to come back,&rdquo; Ramsey said. And so he did wheelchair, crutches and all. It&rsquo;s not easy poking around in a race car from a wheelchair, and Ramsey&rsquo;s classmates offered lots of support, after dubbing him Bootie Barker after the Sprint Cup series crew chief in a wheelchair, and Lieutenant Dan after the character in the Forrest Gump story.</p><p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t have asked for a better place to be . . . to have that kind of thing happen, and to be fortunate enough to come back. When I got back, I picked right up and kept diggin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p><p>Ramsey earned his Associate in Applied Science in Technical Studies &ndash; Motorsports Technology in May 2011. A friend of a friend of a friend who happened to be a NASCAR official suggested that he put his name in for a job at NASCAR. A bit skeptical (&ldquo;What are my chances of ever landing a job at NASCAR?&rdquo;) Ramsey procrastinated for a few months until he was urged to fill out an application again.</p><p>When invited for an interview, Ramsey &ndash; who had never had a job interview before &ndash; found himself in a chance face-to-face encounter with Mike Helton, president of NASCAR when he opened the door and wished him a good morning. &ldquo;That was kind of an &lsquo;Oh Boy&rsquo; moment,&rdquo; Ramsey marvels.</p><p>After a series of interviews and multiple nerve-wracking trips in ensuing months to the mailbox looking for a job offer, Ramsey finally landed his position in the K &amp; N Pro Series. Working with the NASCAR family is a dream-come true, he says. Not only is he employed by the largest sanctioning body of stock car racing in the United States, he gets to travel from track to track throughout the season, from March through November.</p><p>As for others who may be seeking a job in the racing industry &ndash; or following a dream of any kind, for that matter &ndash; Ramsey has this advice: Never give up. Always work harder than the next guy. Believe in yourself. Learn the work ethic. These are things that Lou Larosa taught him, he said, along with: Always be doing something and never stand around with your hands in your pockets. If you are 15 minutes early, you are late.</p><p>And this from Drew himself: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do only what&rsquo;s required. Work harder and exceed expectations. If you work your butt off, you can accomplish anything.&rdquo;</p>','','filtered_html');

Nationwide, while great strides have been made at community colleges for student success, the proportion of faculty (including adjuncts) and student services personnel engaged in the work is modest compared to the total number of faculty and staff at the colleges, leaving many students untouched. Further, the reform work has not yet eliminated silos limiting vital collaboration between academic departments and student services. &nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Walmart is committed to addressing the needs of the communities we serve,&rdquo; said Michelle Gilliard of the Walmart Foundation. &ldquo;Community Colleges are a pathway for millions of Americans to gain a valuable education and access to career opportunities. Together with Achieving the Dream, we have set in motion a program that will help ensure more citizens are gaining the valuable education and workforce skills needed to get ahead in the job market.&rdquo;</p><p>Achieving the Dream Leader Colleges &ndash; those institutions that have met high standards of practice and performance and have earned the Leader College distinction - are in the best position to take on deeper levels of faculty engagement and forge stronger connections among student services and academic and vocational departments. Several Leader Colleges have already demonstrated promising faculty engagement in their overall student success efforts. This program will scale the faculty engagement strategies at up to fifteen of these exemplar colleges, and then leverage the leaders of these institutions as peer coaches to help disseminate and adapt the learnings throughout the entire Achieving the Dream Network. The RFP will go live within the next few weeks and a separate notice will be sent via email directly to participating institutions in the Achieving the Dream Network encouraging them to apply.</p><p><strong><em>Leader College Criteria</em></strong><br />Leader Colleges are demonstrating the power of the Achieving the Dream Student-Centered Model of Institutional Improvement. They show us it is possible to raise persistence and graduation rates, close achievement gaps, and change lives. Leader Colleges embody the ultimate goal of Achieving the Dream, and as such, serve as mentors within our community of learners. To be eligible for <em>Leader College </em>distinction, colleges must demonstrate commitment to and progress on the four principles: committed leadership, use of evidence to improve programs and services, broad engagement, and systemic institutional improvement. They must also show three years of sustained improvement of student success on at least one of the following measures of performance:</p><ul><li style=\"margin-left: 0.5in; \">Completion of certificates or degrees</li><li style=\"margin-left: 0.5in; \">Term-to-term and year-to-year retention</li><li style=\"margin-left: 0.5in; \">Completion of college-level math and English courses</li><li style=\"margin-left: 0.5in; \">Advancement from developmental to credit-bearing courses</li><li style=\"margin-left: 0.5in; \">Course completion</li></ul><p>Additionally, each Leader College has successfully implemented at least one student success intervention or initiative that is advancing student outcomes that are of sufficient scale to benefit a substantial proportion of students. Indeed, these institutions have met high standards of practice and performance and Achieving the Dream expects these colleges to serve as mentors within the Achieving the Dream community of learners.

Based on four principles, the model frames the overall work of helping more students, particularly low-income students and students of color, stay in school and earn a college certificate or degree. Each college approaches the work differently, but Achieving the Dream&rsquo;s five-step process provides practical guidelines for keeping the focus where it belongs and building momentum over time. Throughout the process, Achieving the Dream Coaches offer customized support and help each college&rsquo;s core team implement data-informed programs and policies that build long-term, institution-wide commitment to student success.</p><p><strong><em>About Philanthropy at Walmart</em></strong>&nbsp;<br />Walmart and the Walmart Foundation are proud to support initiatives that are helping people live better around the globe.

Since 2009, three out of four students are succeeding in college-level gatekeeper courses irrespective of their initial placement status, according to the college. The increases occurred during a period of unprecedented enrollment growth, with a disproportionately high number of students who needed developmental education.</p><p style=\"border-style: initial; border-color: initial; margin-top: 0.5em; \">In addition, Zane State&nbsp;has partnered with several Ohio colleges to start innovative programs focused on increasing retention. Among the programs was QuickStart, a free, eight-week program for students unsure about their ability to enter college successfully and those who try to register late without applying for federal student aid. In addition, the college has implemented other programs, including conditional admission, learning communities, and pre-enrollment computer training.</p><p style=\"border-style: initial; border-color: initial; margin-top: 0.5em; \">Zane State&nbsp;also is investing in professional development for its employees to foster a broader understanding about the college&rsquo;s &ldquo;personal touch&rdquo; philosophy, its access mission, and the students&rsquo; general backgrounds, which can affect their learning.</p><p style=\"border-style: initial; border-color: initial; margin-top: 0.5em; \">The Leah Meyer Austin Award is sponsored by the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.luminafoundation.org/\" style=\"border-style: initial; border-color: initial; font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; color: rgb(0, 120, 201); \">Lumina Foundation&nbsp;</a>and administered by the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.aacc.nche.edu/\" style=\"border-style: initial; border-color: initial; font-family: inherit; font-style: inherit; color: rgb(0, 120, 201); \">American Association of Community Colleges</a>.</p>','','filtered_html');

Despite very successful student outcomes, the college faced challenges attracting student enrollment and scaling up the initiative to serve a larger target population. The presenters will share strategies and data obtained at two strategic decision points. Panelists will then ask small groups to devise alternative strategies for scaling up enrollment and increasing student engagement, and then share Zane State&rsquo;s actual changes in advising, marketing, and classroom practices. The workshop will be a collaborative exercise in data-informed decisionmaking. Participants will obtain valuable insight into how to adjust to student needs and overcome barriers in developmental education course redesign.</p><ul><li>Becky Ament, Associate Dean for Developmental Education, Zane State College, OH</li><li>Beth Fischer, Director of Institutional Research and Planning, Zane State College, OH</li></ul>','','filtered_html');

Early failure, especially when it involves student loans, can leave a student worse off than before. Turning these students away until the next term often means they will never return. Zane State College uses its QuickStart to College (QS) program (a free, eight-week course that combines career planning, financial aid counseling, individualized basic skills and remediation in writing and math, and placement test preparation) to capture this high-risk group of students. Since 2008, nearly 65% of those who enroll complete, 90% of completers enroll as full-time students the subsequent term, and overall math placements are higher than traditional-entry students. Participants will learn about best practice strategies for pre-enrollment programs and will leave able to identify institutional and situational barriers to early success.

This issue of <i>Data Notes </i>examines characteristics outcome differences between students who enroll in Achieving the Dream colleges immediately after high school and those who delay their enrollments. Nearly one-half of students enrolled in Achieving the Dream Colleges directly after high school. The other half delayed their enrollment for some period of time&mdash;about one-fifth for one to two years, and one-quarter for five years or more.

One of these is the formula used to allocate public funding to institutions.</span></p><p style=\"margin-top: 0.6em; margin-bottom: 1.2em; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 15px; text-align: left; \">Recently, several states have experimented with new performance-based funding models that allocate some percentage of state support on the basis of institutional progress in improving student retention, progression, or completion of credentials, not just on enrollment levels.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-top: 0.6em; margin-bottom: 1.2em; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; line-height: 15px; text-align: left; \">This brief presents a set of JFF-produced tools that can help states design performance-based funding systems that can influence student and institutional behavior, avoid unintended consequences, and withstand shifts in political and economic climates. These &ldquo;Performance Funding 2.0&rdquo; tools are based primarily on the experience of states participating in Achieving the Dream and the Developmental Education Initiative that have moved toward a new performance funding model in recent years.&nbsp;</p>','','filtered_html');

Efficient use of funds will be achieved by increasing capacity and reducing duplication of efforts by colleges within the consortium.</p><div align=\"center\"><hr align=\"center\" size=\"1\" width=\"90%\" /></div><p style=\"margin-left: 15pt;\"><strong>DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA</strong></p><p style=\"margin-left: 15pt;\"><strong>Community College of the District of Columbia</strong><br /><strong>Consortium Member</strong>&nbsp;<strong>&mdash;</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.dol.gov/opa/media/press/eta/eta20111409fs.htm#oh\" target=\"_blank\">Cincinnati State Technical and Community College Consortium</a><br /><strong>Total Consortium Award Amount:</strong>&nbsp;$19,613,306</p><div align=\"center\"><hr align=\"center\" size=\"1\" width=\"90%\" /></div><p style=\"margin-left: 15pt;\"><strong>FLORIDA</strong></p><p style=\"margin-left: 15pt;\"><strong>Florida State College at Jacksonville</strong><br /><strong>Consortium Member &mdash;&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"http://www.dol.gov/opa/media/press/eta/eta20111409fs.htm#md\" target=\"_blank\">Anne Arundel Community College consortium</a><br /><strong>Total Consortium Award Amount: $19,730,281</strong></p><div align=\"center\"><hr align=\"center\" size=\"1\" width=\"90%\" /></div><p style=\"margin-left: 15pt;\"><strong>GEORGIA</strong></p><p style=\"margin-left: 15pt;\"><strong>North Georgia Technical College</strong><br /><strong>Total Award Amount: $2,546,186</strong></p><p style=\"margin-left: 15pt;\">This proposal will develop a career pathway that includes multiple entry and exit points and that leads to an industry-recognized credential &mdash; and to a job in health care.

The developmental program &quot;Just in TIME (Teaching Innovations in Math and English)&quot; will focus on contextualized curriculum development. These programs will address the high percentage (70-80 percent) of students placing into remedial (6th-9th grade skill level) or developmental (10th-12th grade skill level) UHCC math and English courses. The innovation is profound in that remediation and developmental education will be tailored by sector and delivered alongside workforce training. The final component to achieving full effectiveness of this systemic redesign is the implementation of wrap-around services through a &quot;Wiki Start&quot; model. The Wiki Start model will include evidence- based academic student coaching as a cost-effective strategy to increase retention and graduation by 10-15 percent, fueling the success of the proposed initiatives. The UHCCs will also build certificate and training programs based on meeting employer needs.

Through wraparound student support via career coaches, rapid remediation and contextualized core skills, and an online platform to ensure statewide connectivity, we will build capacity to prepare TAA and TAA-like individuals with skills for the advanced manufacturing and logistics, energy distribution, production and conservation, and health care technology industries.</p><div align=\"center\"><hr align=\"center\" size=\"1\" width=\"90%\" /></div><p style=\"margin-left: 15pt;\"><strong>SOUTH CAROLINA</strong></p><p style=\"margin-left: 15pt;\"><strong>Florence-Darlington Technical College</strong><br /><strong>Consortium Leader<br />Total Consortium Award Amount: $19,984,039</strong></p><p style=\"margin-left: 15pt;\">Consortium members:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.achievingthedream.org/college_profile/aiken_technical_college\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Aiken Technical College</strong></a>; Central Carolina Technical College; Denmark Technical College; Horry-Georgetown Technical College; Midlands Technical College; Northeastern Technical College;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.achievingthedream.org/college_profile/orangeburg_calhoun_technical_college\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Orangeburg-Calhoun Technical College</strong></a>; Piedmont Technical College; Williamsburg Technical College; Clemson University</p><p style=\"margin-left: 15pt;\"><em>ASSIST&nbsp;</em>will facilitate the attainment of educational and employment goals for students resulting in industry-recognized credentials and degrees, employment, job retention and family-sustaining wages in high-tech, high-demand jobs.

The number of students ages 50 to 64 increased 17 percent nationwide between fall 2007 and fall 2009, according to the latest data available from the National Center for Education Statistics.</p><p>The growth has been even more dramatic at Columbus State Community College. The number of students age 50 or older increased more than 81 percent, to 1,506 students, between fall 2007 and fall last year. That age group is the fastest-growing population at the school.</p><p>&ldquo;It used to be that many older adults came to college to help pass the time during their retirement and to enrich their lives,&rdquo; said Chandra Bell, a counselor and career-assistance coordinator at Columbus State. But people are now coming back &ldquo;because they have lost their jobs, need new skills to keep their jobs or are planning a new career because they can&rsquo;t afford to retire as planned,&rdquo; Bell said.</p><p>With 78 million baby boomers entering their retirement years, the country &mdash; not to mention Ohio &mdash; needs more of these experienced workers to stay in the work force longer, even in part-time positions, officials said.</p><p>&ldquo;Keeping older workers engaged in the labor force is vital for the continued economic growth of our region,&rdquo; said Bill LaFayette, a Columbus economist and owner of the consulting firm Regionomics .</p><p>The labor force growth rate is already declining and is projected to slow to a crawl between 2020 and 2025 because of the exodus of baby boomers, he said.</p><p>With people living longer, healthier lives, there is also a new demand for programs designed to train the over-50 population, said Celia Crossley, a career strategist and managing partner of Crosworks in Columbus.</p><p>Last year, about 36 percent of workers said they expected to keep working past age 65, compared with 20 percent in 2001, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a different world today where 50 to 70 is considered the new &lsquo;middle age,&rsquo;  &rdquo; Crossley said.</p><p>Martha Harrison, 52, of Powell started playing with the idea of going back to college in 2005 after more than 20 years as a preschool teacher. She was motivated by two primary factors: money, and a desire to get a counseling degree to help children deal with their increasingly complicated home lives.</p><p>&ldquo;Preschool teachers barely make above minimum wage, which makes no sense when you think about taking care of someone&rsquo;s most-valuable asset,&rdquo; Harrison said.</p><p>She tried a few online psychology classes with a for-profit college in 2005 but didn&rsquo;t really get started on her education until she enrolled at Columbus State&rsquo;s Delaware campus in fall 2010. Harrison has enjoyed school so much she wants to transfer to Ohio State to work on a bachelor&rsquo;s degree and eventually earn a master&rsquo;s so she can become a school counselor. She isn&rsquo;t daunted by her age.</p><p>&ldquo;The way I look at it, people my age, we have maybe 25 or more years left of working in us, especially in something that we enjoy,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>When Newman lost his job, he and his wife, Deb, who is a stay-at-home mom, had saved about half of what they thought they might need to sustain themselves for about six months with no other income.</p><p>&ldquo;We were glad to have made such decisions, despite not having had time to complete our preparation,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>Through friends, Newman immediately landed a job as a marketing director for a men&rsquo;s legwear company in Granville. He took a job 11 months later as a traffic engineer for the Ohio Department of Transportation.</p><p>But neither worked out long term. So the father of four signed up for a free three-week program at Columbus State that was created to train dislocated workers in logistics &mdash; the movement and storage of goods from the beginning to the end of a supply chain.</p><p>After the training, Newman got a job as an inventory specialist at ODW Logistics Inc. in Columbus. He then enrolled in a three-quarter-long online certificate program at Columbus State, which helped him move to a more-advanced job at the pharmaceutical company of Boehringer Ingelheim Roxane Inc.</p><p>Even though Newman had earned a bachelor&rsquo;s degree from Ohio State in 1984, going back to college was challenging, he said.</p><p>&ldquo;In the past 13 days, I&rsquo;ve had to read seven chapters, take nine quizzes, solve four sets of problems, take one midterm and two finals &mdash; and that doesn&rsquo;t even count working 40 hours and spending time with my family.&rdquo;</p><p>Newman is just thankful for a second chance, even though he&rsquo;s making $60,000 a year less than his peak salary as a civil engineer. He&rsquo;s also looking forward to working his way up in what he hopes turns out to be a long, successful second career.</p><p>&ldquo;Getting laid off was quite a blow,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But finding something else to go after and making strides to move ahead has me feeling good again.&rdquo;</p>','','filtered_html');

INSERT INTO `field_data_body` VALUES ('node','news',0,2953,5390,'und',0,'<p>By Anthony Bryk and Thomas Toch</p><p>The Obama administration is right to make community colleges a cornerstone of its plan to close skill gaps and put people back to work. The nation&rsquo;s 1,200 community colleges enroll 6.7 million students, or nearly half the U.S. undergraduate population. They are key institutions in today&rsquo;s education-intensive economy.<br /><br />But there is a gaping hole in the community college pipeline: some 60 percent of incoming community college students must complete one or more remedial courses before working toward degrees, and upwards of 70 percent of students in these &quot;developmental&quot; math courses don&rsquo;t complete them. As a result, the higher education careers of many students are over before they begin.<br /><br />Researchers at Teachers College Columbia University have attracted wide coverage for <a href=\"http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2012/02/29/too-many-community-college-students-are-placing-remedial-classes-studies-find\">a recent study</a> arguing that as many as one in four community college students placed in remedial courses would pass regular college-level classes if given the chance to enroll in them. But whether that&rsquo;s true or not, vast numbers of students arrive at community colleges woefully unprepared and there&rsquo;s little chance of substantially expanding the community college sector&rsquo;s role in economic development unless we help students catch up.<br /><br />The solution lies in rethinking remedial education. With the support of five national philanthropies, the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching has launched a national network of 27 community colleges and three universities dedicated to helping students at the greatest risk of failure in math. The approach uses a comprehensive strategy of support for students and faculty members in a &quot;networked improvement community.&quot; It&rsquo;s early in the life of the project, but the results so far are encouraging.<br /><br />The strategy starts with dramatically altering the nature of instruction. Teaching students the same content the same way over and over is obviously not working. Those who failed to move beyond arithmetic in middle school, and who didn&rsquo;t grasp key concepts any more fully during re-teaching in high school, are unlikely to master them if they are presented in the same abstract and rote fashion once more in community college.<br /><br />Instead, the Carnegie network&rsquo;s instruction and online out-of-class resources focus on the statistics and quantitative reasoning that matters most for students&rsquo; work, personal and civic lives. There are units on &quot;Seven Billion and Counting,&quot; &quot;The Credit Crunch&quot; and &quot;Has the Minimum Wage Kept Up?&quot; Students learn math through themes such as citizenship and personal finance. It&#39;s rigorous stuff, but relevant and engaging, requiring students to use the tools of algebra, statistics, data visualizations and analysis to solve meaningful, real-world problems as a way of thinking mathematically.<br /><br />The network is also using a number of promising psychological and motivational strategies to overcome students&#39; pervasive math anxiety and other debilitating stereotypic beliefs and give them the confidence and drive they need to work hard and be successful. The effort includes helping faculty members create positive and productive learning environments through carefully designed team-building activities, protocols for classroom discussions, &quot;classroom contracts&quot; that foster camaraderie and group responsibility, and other strategies.<br /><br />To the same end, the network is reconceptualizing students&#39; homework assignments, replacing traditional rote exercises with problem- and scenario-based exercises that extend classroom learning. We&#39;re taking the obvious but often-neglected step of helping the many community college students for whom English isn&#39;t their first language navigate communication barriers.<br /><br />And the project has abandoned the traditional model of the independent faculty member working in isolation in favor of a network strategy that allows faculty to work together across campuses to build common instructional systems and improve the program in real time through the network&rsquo;s ongoing collection of student and faculty feedback (including strategies such as quick surveys delivered via students&rsquo; cell phones) and other information on instruction, instructional materials and student performance.<br /><br />Importantly, community colleges in the project grant college credit toward certificates and degrees to students who complete the new, rigorous yearlong Carnegie &ldquo;pathways,&rdquo; saving students the often-demoralizing delay of taking noncredit classes (the norm for remedial courses in higher education).<br /><br />Colleges pay just over $20,000 a year, the equivalent of about a half-dozen student tuitions, to participate in the network. Some pay less. By increasing the success rate in developmental courses, the network helps colleges extend student enrollments and increase graduation rates -- giving them a potentially substantial return on their investment.</p><p>The network&rsquo;s early results are promising, even with a largely high-risk student population. Nearly half the students in network colleges are from households with incomes below $40,000 a year. And only 10 percent have mothers with at least a bachelor&rsquo;s degree. Yet 89 percent remained enrolled for the full fall term (the program rolled out in the network&rsquo;s colleges at the beginning of the 2011-12 school year) and 68 percent finished the first semester with a grade of C or better (required for college credit), nearly double the 36 percent of students earning the same grades in the less-demanding courses taught previously in the network&#39;s schools.<br /><br />The students who completed the new courses scored nearly as high on an independent end-of-semester exam as a national sample of community college and university students who had completed college-level statistics coursework. And 88 percent of the students earning C&#39;s or better moved on to the second half of the two-semester, credit-yielding course. That&#39;s more than triple the proportion of students in the network&#39;s colleges who successfully navigated a first term of remedial math and signed up for a second before the network&#39;s creation.<br /><br />And we know from surveys that the program&rsquo;s confidence-building components increase students&rsquo; enthusiasm for math, and make students less anxious about the subject and more likely to believe that with hard work they could master it &mdash; a complete turnaround from the typical perspectives of students in traditional developmental math classes.<br /><br />The test of the new network model will be sustaining these early results as we scale from 1,600 students today to our target of 62,000 a year by 2017-18. But the encouraging early evidence suggests that it is possible to reverse the pernicious culture of failure among community college students, that a comprehensive improvement strategy can put them on a surer path to a truly higher education.</p>','','filtered_html');

And for the next hour students stepped on stage, spoke into the microphone, and presented their solutions with professionalism, poise, and deep conviction.</p><p>After each presentation, the students in the audience voted on the projects using criteria such as creativity, sustainability, and use of new media.</p><p>The top five projects won a piece of a $25,000 prize to implement their projects, based on the student votes.</p><p>While only five projects received funding, each of the 13 groups will receive training and support from Mobilize.org.</p><p>The students who attended the conference represented the historically underrepresented population in higher education. Most of them work while going to college and have to juggle a multitude of responsibilities in addition to college coursework. Yet despite &ndash; or perhaps because of &ndash; the obstacles they&rsquo;ve faced in achieving their education, they have decided to give everything they have to help other students.</p><p>The 21-year-old leader of the winning project, Aylwing Olivas, was an undocumented student from Nicaragua. He along with three other Miami Dade College students - Edwin Ramos, Michelle Sfeir, and Jennifer González &ndash; proposed the High School Community Outreach project to address the problem of low graduation rates of undocumented students.</p><p>The winning project will target and educate teens from 9-12th grades through mentoring, classroom presentations, and an informative website that will motivate the teens to pursue college by providing them with information about scholarships and institutions that welcome students regardless of their legal status.</p><p>The four other winning projects include:</p><p>#2 My College Guide (Broward College, South campus): This student-run editorial magazine and coinciding app is meant to increase awareness of opportunities to get involved and take advantage of resources on campus. It will provide information about organizations on campus, upcoming academic events, campus maps, student resources, scholarships, and service learning opportunities. Led by students Ajah McPherson, Albert Hourie, Crishell Bautista, and Serge Michel.</p><p>#3 Students&rsquo; Excellent Expansive College Experience - SEECE (Miami Dade College, Hialeah, North and InterAmerican campuses): This new center will offer personal tutoring, advisement and other types of academic and moral support in order to provide individual and specialized assistance to struggling students. Led by students Jannette Nunen, Laiyen Susrez, Amalia Mariaca, Paula Vieira, Frank Pellegrino, Stefan Moore, Gerard Pean, and Mac Dineen.</p><p>#4 Improving Graduation Rates with a Four-Course Success Sequence (Miami Dade College, InterAmerican campus): This series of four workshops will be piloted for 100 students, and will focus on study skills, transferring to a four-year institution, choosing a major, and developing career skills. The project aims to expand the workshops into a larger set of courses available for credit and to the entire student population. Led by students Joanna Matthews-Pace, Abril Mariaca, Axel Turcios, and Ari Peña, who will be attending Georgetown University this Fall. &nbsp;</p><p>#5 Breaking Down the Barriers (Miami Dade College, Wolfson campus): This program seeks to help women break through barriers and improve self-esteem by providing workshops, panel discussions, and support groups called Sister Circles. The group seeks to help women with issues such as safe sex, pregnancy, and health, as well as promote college completion and direct women towards helpful resources, such as childcare.

The following represents their top answers based:<br /><br /><b>1. What challenges do students face in completing their education?</b></p><p>&ldquo;Students are at a loss at the initial start of college. With lack of advisement a student cannot form a plan in which they create successful strategies. Students don&#39;t know what classes they should take towards a major - lack of orientation.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Finance - lack of money, not enough financial aid. Strict requirements for financial aid.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Books for classes - too many editions, teachers never use it. &nbsp;Too expensive, not online, problems getting them.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p><b>2. What can government officials do to improve college completion rates in Florida?</b></p><p>&ldquo;Lower tuition rates. No extra fees. No higher rates. And stop increasing rates on loans.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Increase the money for education (budget) instead of using it for other purposes (i.e. jail, incarceration). The students need that money.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The passage of the Dream Act. Rally support within the state for the Dream Act. Create laws to protect undocumented students.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p><b>3. What can administration officials, faculty and staff at academic institutions do to help improve completion rates at our schools?</b></p><p>&ldquo;Advisement needs to improve - training should be enforced because faculty and staff need to be more motivated to help students succeed.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;Stop standardizing education. Instead provide students with a well rounded and civically engaged education.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p><b>4. What can Millennials do to ensure we achieve our individual and collective academic goals?</b></p><p>&ldquo;Become a leader and take a stand - involve yourself in memberships such as clubs and mentorships in order to network and professionalize yourself.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Millennials shall not be afraid to invest in the future - Find grants for scholarships and network for your future.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;As a whole - Millennials should network with others and inform their fellow Millennials on what they can accomplish with focused motivation.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>On the final day of the summit students presented their solutions in the form of projects ranging from an informative college app to a mentorship program for undocumented students.

Further, the reform work has not yet eliminated the disconnections between academic departments and student services that limit vital collaboration. Achieving the Dream Leader Colleges, known for their commitment to student-centered evidence-based reforms and outstanding increases in student outcomes, were deemed a most ideal network of colleges for testing and expanding innovative faculty and staff engagement strategies.</p><p>Through a competitive process, 15 of 50 eligible Achieving the Dream Leader Colleges were selected to participate in the <em>Walmart PRESS for Completion</em> grant program<em>. </em>The grant will include a 27-month process during which the selected colleges will receive technical assistance and support from Achieving the Dream. In addition, each selected college has agreed to serve as a peer coach and be active in the learning community among the other 175+ colleges in the larger Achieving the Dream National Reform Network. Ultimately, at least 100,000 students stand to benefit directly, and 3.75 million indirectly, from this grant program.</p><p>Durham Technical Community College&rsquo;s grant proposal provides an excellent example of what selected colleges intend to do with the grant funds. Through the <em>Walmart PRESS for Completion</em> grant program, Durham Technical Community College will work for <em>total</em> engagement of faculty (particularly adjunct faculty) and staff in their campus-based student success reform efforts. The college intends to increase course completion rates while remaining committed to their guiding principles: equity above equality, data-informed decision making, and committed leadership. As part of its grant-funded efforts, Durham Technical Community College will hold <em>PRESS for Completion</em> convocations, which will foster &ldquo;courageous&rdquo; conversations about quantitative and qualitative course completion data; form <em>PRESS for Completion</em> teams to investigate the student success data for 12 high-risk courses (courses in which student completion is particularly low and failure rates are particularly high, courses with high attendance, and &ldquo;gatekeeper&rdquo; courses which prepare them for higher level coursework); assure additional faculty and staff engagement through&nbsp;<em>PRESS</em> <em>for Completion</em> workshops&nbsp;which will be open to all faculty and staff; and employ <em>PRESS</em> <em>for Completion</em> student and social media ambassadors to engage students in the <em>PRESS for Completion</em> work on campus.</p><p>&ldquo;Achieving the Dream has helped us make tremendous differences in the lives of our students since 2005. Our data continues to confirm that we are seeing significant advances in student success &ndash; including gains in first-to-second semester persistence, narrowing of the persistence gap for minority men, and graduating students in higher numbers than ever,&rdquo; said William G. &ldquo;Bill&rdquo; Ingram, President of Durham Technical Community College. &ldquo;This exciting new <em>Walmart PRESS for Completion </em>grant program in partnership with Achieving the Dream will enable us to expand and deepen our institutional reform efforts and ultimately fulfill our mission of &lsquo;enriching students&rsquo; lives and the broader community through teaching, learning, and service&rsquo; by positioning our students, faculty, and staff for success.&rdquo;</p><p>Representatives from the 15 selected colleges, including Durham Technical Community College, will convene for an inaugural <em>Walmart PRESS for Completion</em> Grant Recipient Kickoff Institute at the Hyatt Hotel in Reston, VA&nbsp;from&nbsp;June 24 &ndash; June 26, 2012. &nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>The Achieving the Dream Model</em></strong></p><p>Achieving the Dream Institutions commit to the Achieving the Dream Student-Centered Model of Institutional Improvement. Based on four principles, the model frames the overall work of helping more students, particularly low-income students and students of color, stay in school and earn a college credential. Each college approaches the work differently, but Achieving the Dream&rsquo;s five-step process provides practical guidelines for keeping the focus where it belongs and building momentum over time. Throughout the process, Achieving the Dream Coaches offer customized support and help each college&rsquo;s core team implement data-informed programs and policies that build long-term, institution-wide commitment to student success.</p><p><strong><em>Achieving the Dream Leader Colleges</em></strong></p><p>Leader Colleges are demonstrating the power of the Achieving the Dream Student-Centered Model of Institutional Improvement. They show that it is possible to raise persistence and graduation rates, close achievement gaps, and improve lives. Leader Colleges embody the ultimate goal of Achieving the Dream, and as such, serve as mentors within a community of learners. To be eligible for Leader College distinction, colleges must demonstrate commitment to and progress on the four principles: committed leadership, use of evidence to improve programs and services, broad engagement, and systemic institutional improvement. They must also show three years of sustained improvement of student success on at least one of the following measures of performance:</p><ul><li>Completion of certificates or degrees</li><li>Term-to-term and year-to-year retention</li><li>Completion of college-level math and English courses</li><li>Advancement from developmental to credit-bearing courses</li><li>Course completion</li></ul><p>Additionally, each Leader College has successfully implemented at least one student success intervention or initiative that is advancing student outcomes that are of sufficient scale to benefit a substantial proportion of students. Indeed, these institutions have met high standards of practice and performance and Achieving the Dream expects these colleges to serve as mentors within the Achieving the Dream community of learners.

INSERT INTO `field_data_body` VALUES ('node','news',0,3402,7706,'und',0,'<p>A man named Gerald Chertavian came by my office not long ago, and, by the time he left, I was filled with renewed appreciation for the potential of community colleges to help stem the decline of the middle class. There are few more urgent tasks.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">Chertavian is not the president of a community college or even a teacher at one. Rather, he runs a program, <a href=\"http://www.yearup.org/about/main.php?page=history\">Year Up</a>, which he founded, that makes it possible for poor high school graduates to land good jobs. It does so, in part, by imparting important soft skills that the upper-middle-class take for granted, like how to interact with colleagues in an office setting.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">A second aspect of the program involves teaching marketable skills in such areas as computer support, say, or back-office work at financial firms. These are called middle-skill jobs; they require more than a high school education but less than a four-year baccalaureate degree. Thirty years ago, said Chertavian, middle-skill jobs didn&rsquo;t exist. &ldquo;There were jobs that required a college degree, and jobs that didn&rsquo;t. Now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;up to a third of all jobs are middle-skill jobs.&rdquo; Almost universally, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/28/business/smallbusiness/even-with-high-unemployment-some-small-businesses-struggle-to-fill-positions.html\" title=\"A Times article\">companies complain</a> that they can&rsquo;t find enough workers to fill those jobs.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">As a result, Chertavian has had no trouble rounding up corporations like General Electric and Bank of America to give internships to his charges; if all goes well &mdash; and it usually does &mdash; they wind up with a well-paying job. The entry-level pay can be as much as $40,000 a year.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">The trouble with programs like Chertavian&rsquo;s is that they are akin to pebbles being thrown in the ocean. He has identified a sweet spot in the economy &mdash; matching motivated, but disadvantaged, young people with a genuine economic need. But Year Up, which operates in nine cities, can absorb only 1,400 students a year. What about the millions of others who don&rsquo;t have access to a program like that?</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">It was when I posed that question to Chertavian that he started talking about community colleges. He is a fierce believer in their transformative potential. All the students in Year Up are also required to be enrolled in a local community college, but, more recently, Chertavian has begun to affiliate more formally with community colleges. That would allow Year Up to reach many more students.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">Most notably, it is about to begin operating at Miami Dade College, which has a staggering 174,000 students.&nbsp;Its president, Eduardo Padrón, says that 90 percent of its students are minorities, 40 percent live in poverty and 60 percent require remedial education.&nbsp;Many are enrolled in four-year baccalaureate programs; though it remains primarily a community college, in recent years, it has begun offering four-year degrees.&nbsp; But most are not. &nbsp;They are looking to earn a certificate or an associate degree and acquire a skill that will lead to a good job.&nbsp;</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">&ldquo;Community colleges are the great American invention in terms of education,&rdquo; Padrón said at a recent panel discussion I attended in Aspen, Colo. Their raison d&rsquo;être has always been to help grease the wheels of social mobility. But, in their earlier incarnation, they were primarily seen as a passageway to a university degree. (They used to be called junior colleges, after all.) Now with the skills gap such a pressing problem &mdash; and a high school education so clearly inadequate for the modern economy &mdash; the task of teaching those skills is falling to community colleges. There really isn&rsquo;t another institution as well positioned to play that role.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">I wish I could say that state legislatures were pouring resources into community colleges, but, of course, I can&rsquo;t. Many state governments have <a href=\"http://chronicle.com/article/Why-Community-Colleges-May/131636/\" title=\"A Chronicle of Higher Education article\">ravaged the budgets of their community college systems</a>, just as they have for many state university systems. In Florida, said Padrón, community colleges have seen their state support drop by 21 percent in three years. &ldquo;State support used to account for 75 percent of our budget,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now it is only 45 percent.&rdquo; As a result, <a href=\"http://www.mdc.edu/main/academics/tuition.aspx\">tuition at Miami Dade</a> is $3,000 a year &mdash; a lot of money for people of little means. Given what&rsquo;s at stake, it would be hard to imagine anything more shortsighted than paring back support for community colleges.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">Nor can it be said that all community colleges have stepped up to this new role. In some states, such as Virginia and North Carolina, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/01/education/schools-try-to-match-the-jobless-with-3-4-million-jobs.html\" title=\"A Times article\">community colleges have become</a> deeply connected with employers in the state. In others, they remain the stepchildren of the educational system. <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/2012/04/21/report-community-college-attendance-up-but-graduation-rates-remain-low\">Graduation rates are low</a>. <a href=\"http://theweek.com/article/index/226386/should-colleges-charge-more-for-popular-classes\">Overcrowding is common</a>.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">&ldquo;Yes, there are many institutions that need to do a much better job adapting to and connecting with labor markets,&rdquo; Chertavian wrote in a follow-up e-mail message to me. But he remains hopeful. &ldquo;They are the mechanism that creates pathways to get young people into the economy,&rdquo; he said.</p><p itemprop=\"articleBody\">Community colleges can be our salvation, if only we let them.</p><div class=\"authorIdentification\"><p>Frank Bruni is off today.</p></div><p>&nbsp;</p>','','filtered_html');

Leader Colleges are selected based on their commitment to and progress on four principles: committed leadership, use of evidence to improve programs and services, broad engagement, and systemic institutional improvement. They must also show three years of sustained improvement of student success.</p><p>The grants are intended to get faculty and staff more involved in student success efforts.</p><p>&ldquo;These 15 Achieving the Dream Leader Colleges have met high standards of practice and performance and are well-positioned to tackle one of the toughest community college reform challenges our nation is facing: engaging more full-time and adjunct faculty and staff in student success efforts,&rdquo; said Rachel Singer, vice president of Achieving the Dream, Inc.</p><p>While community colleges have made significant strides in boosting student success rates, the proportion of faculty, including adjunct faculty, and student services personnel deeply engaged in the work is small compared to the total number of faculty and staff at the colleges. Moreover, reform work has yet to knock down the silos between academic departments and student services that limit vital collaboration, according to ATD.</p><p>Achieving the Dream Leader Colleges, known for their commitment to student-centered, evidence-based reforms were deemed a most ideal network of colleges for testing and expanding innovative faculty and staff engagement strategies. The 15 colleges were selected to receive a Walmart PRESS (Persistence, Retention, and Student Success) grant.</p><p>The grant will include a 27-month process during which the selected colleges will receive technical assistance and support from Achieving the Dream. In addition, each selected college has agreed to serve as a peer coach and be active in the learning community among the more than 175 colleges in the Achieving the Dream network.</p><p>The winning colleges are Aiken Technical College (Aiken, S.C.); Alamo Colleges, (San Antonio, Texas); Brazosport College (Lake Jackson, Texas); Community College of Beaver County (Monaca, Pa.); Cuyahoga Community College (Cleveland, Ohio); Durham Technical Community College (Durham, N.C.); Guilford Technical Community College (Jamestown, N.C.); Northampton Community College, (Bethlehem, Pa.); Northern Essex Community College (Haverhill, Mass.); Orangeburg-Calhoun Technical College (Orangeburg, S.C.); Pulaski Technical College (North Little Rock, Ark.); Roxbury Community College (Boston, Mass.); Tallahassee Community College (Tallahassee, Fla.); Valencia College (Orlando, Fla.) and Yakima Valley Community College (Yakima, Wash.)</p>','','filtered_html');

But many are starting to question the value of college education versus taxpayer and student dollars spent. The questions are worth asking, and smart colleges will respond with answers and action.</p><p>Earlier this month, 850 people graduated with 996 degrees and certificates from Linn-Benton Community College. I am confident they will improve both their own lives and the quality of life in our communities.</p><p>But a recent report card for higher education issued by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce gave Oregon community colleges an &ldquo;F&rdquo; for the amount of money spent per degree earned.</p><p>The measurements had their flaws. The Chamber used a model developed for four-year universities that doesn&rsquo;t consider the number of students in non-degree programs such as adult basic education, GED and community education. Many argue that the &ldquo;IPEDs&rdquo; model is no longer an accurate measure even for four-year universities.</p><p>However, our own data are enough for us to know we&rsquo;re not earning an &ldquo;A.&rdquo; LBCC&rsquo;s &ldquo;success rate&rdquo; is 34 percent (12 percent of our students earn degrees or certificates and another 22 percent transfer to four-year colleges and universities).</p><p>We can and must do better to help more of our citizens finish what they start at LBCC.</p><p>The Oregon Education Investment Board&rsquo;s goals and achievement compacts are a good start. They challenge the education system to ensure 40 percent of adults have a bachelor&rsquo;s degree, 40 percent have a two-year degree or job-ready certificate, and 20 percent have at least a high school diploma or the equivalent by 2025.</p><p>That means LBCC must increase the number of people earning degrees or certificates from 850 to 1,350 per year. Despite significant cuts in state funding over the past three years, our first moves must be to do new and better things with the resources we have.</p><p>Already we are discussing new educational design that will fit a broader array of learning styles and life circumstances. We hope to have more balance of online and face-to-face instruction. We are considering options that are not time-based. Some people can quickly master concepts and competencies in some subject areas. They should not be held back. Others need more time. They should not be dubbed failures because of that.</p><p>By fall, LBCC will launch new initiatives to better prepare students to succeed. From point of first contact through their enrollment, we will better prepare people to make important choices, and establish key relationships inside LBCC. Research indicates these are keys to college success and completion.</p><p>LBCC was also selected this year to join the national Achieving the Dream network of community colleges. This resource will help us better document what processes are helping and hindering our students to complete in the most efficient way.</p><p>And we continue to work closely with local partners in industry to ensure our programs are aligned with the kind of skilled workers they need.</p><p>We know we are changing lives for the better every day. We hear stories from our alumni that confirm this. But we also know if we do not do more, our economy and our community will not thrive.</p><p>I&rsquo;m confident LBCC will meet this challenge.</p><p><em>Greg Hamann is the president of Linn-Benton Community College.</em></p></div><p>&nbsp;</p>','','filtered_html');

What if Ali didn&#39;t recover? How could Porter support her and her baby, for years, on the little money she was bringing in?</p><p><em>This is insane,</em> Porter told herself. <em>I can&#39;t live like this. I&#39;ve got to do something.</em></p><p>She has.</p><p>In a few weeks, Susie Porter leaves for upstate New York to begin her junior year of college on a full scholarship -- room and board included -- at an Ivy League research university, Cornell.</p><p>&quot;If you have a dream, if you <em>had</em> a dream, it&#39;s never too late to go for it,&quot; Porter says.</p><p>&quot;My God, I&#39;m 54 years old, and I&#39;m going off to college.&quot;</p><p>It all happened because a friend stopped by the restaurant, as he did every morning, and told her he was going back to school, that he&#39;d gotten enough financial aid to make it work.</p><p>&quot;You can get grants and you can get loans and you&#39;ll be OK,&quot; he told Porter on that cold January morning, 21/2 years ago.</p><p>&quot;I&#39;ll show you how.&quot;</p><p>Porter sat down next to him, right there in the restaurant with her granddaughter on her lap, and applied to <a href=\"http://www.csuohio.edu/\">Cleveland State University</a>.</p><p>Her next piece of good fortune was getting an adviser who explained CSU&#39;s partnership program with <a href=\"http://www.tri-c.edu/Pages/default.aspx\">Cuyahoga Community College</a>, which allowed Porter to take less expensive Tri-C courses that counted toward a CSU<strong> </strong>degree.</p><p>Porter jumped on that.</p><p>But even with the lower tuition, she needed grants and loans to make it.</p><p>The first semester, she enrolled in three online classes, taking nine credit hours, so she could continue to take care of her daughter and granddaughter and because she was nervous about starting college in her 50s.</p><p>&quot;It had been 34 years since I had been in high school,&quot; she says, &quot;and I was wondering if I could still learn.&quot;</p><p>She got straight A&#39;s.</p><p>And she kept at it, choosing urban affairs as her major.</p><p>Her grades were good enough to get her into the honors program as well as induction into <a href=\"http://www.ptk.org/?destination=node\">Phi Theta Kappa</a>, the academic honor society for two-year colleges. She was accepted into the <a href=\"http://www.tri-c.edu/programs/honors/Pages/RobertLLewisAcademyofScholars.aspx\">Robert L. Lewis Academy of Scholars</a>, too.</p><p>Scholarship money started coming in after that.</p><p>Then, in September 2011, she opened the mailbox and pulled out a letter from Cornell, inviting her to apply to its School of Industrial and Labor Relations. It was a perfect fit. She&#39;d always been interested in workers&#39; rights and social justice.</p><p>&quot;Yeah, right,&quot; Porter said when she&#39;d finished reading. And she laughs a soft, sweet laugh that hints at her Texas and Louisiana roots.</p><p>With her daughter healed and the restaurant closed, she went ahead and called the admissions office, just as the letter suggested.</p><p>The following month, she made the 5 1/2-hour drive to Ithaca, N.Y.,<strong> </strong>to check out the campus.</p><p>She was sold.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s huge,&quot; Porter says. &quot;But even in its enormity it feels like you are just absolutely enveloped in this nurturing environment. It feels like it just wraps itself around you.&quot;</p><p>In February, she sent in her application.</p><p>Weeks later, on a Friday night, she looked down at her cellphone and saw she&#39;d missed a call. She checked voicemail. Ian Schachner, the associate director for admissions for the School of Industrial and Labor Relations, wanted to talk to her.</p><p><em>This can&#39;t be good, </em>Porter thought. <em>You get the fat envelope in the mail when you&#39;re accepted.</em></p><p>And she fretted all weekend.</p><p>When she called back on Monday, Schachner told her he didn&#39;t want her to wait for an answer any longer. Cornell wanted her.</p><p>&quot;When he hung up,&quot; Porter says, &quot;I cried like a baby.&quot;</p><p>Porter knew her acceptance meant she&#39;d get financial help, too, because of Cornell&#39;s policy of providing scholarships to students who can&#39;t afford tuition, room and board.</p><p>That letter came later.</p><p>The total value of the school&#39;s offer: $56,497 for just the first year.</p><p>Schachner says Porter is the kind of student Cornell searches for.</p><p>&quot;We talk a lot about diversity in education, and diversity is often spoken of as race or ethnicity,&quot; he said in a telephone interview. &quot;But it also means diversity in life experiences.</p><p>&quot;We love students who have been out there for a while -- people who can help the younger students realize, &#39;Hey, this is actually what goes on in organizations, this is how the world really works.&#39; &quot;</p><p>His message to other students: forget about the barriers you think are there.</p><p>&quot;There&#39;s an enormous number of fears that they have: &#39;I can&#39;t afford it, they&#39;d never take me, I wouldn&#39;t be able to do the work, I don&#39;t have the support,&#39; &quot;Schachner says.</p><p>&quot;The only thing that matches the number of fears they have is the actual support that exists to help them.&quot;</p><p>And that support, Porter says, is a gift she never would have received if not for the people who helped her along the way. And if not for Tri-C.</p><p>&quot;Ian told me that he had rarely seen a transfer student come in with as many transferable credits as I had,&quot; she says. &quot;That really says a lot for Tri-C.&quot;</p><p>And it means more students like her can get into schools like Cornell, Porter says. She&#39;s willing to help them do it.

But one of the most promising alternative credentialing movements &ndash; the manufacturing industry&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.themanufacturinginstitute.org/Education-Workforce/Skills-Certification-System/Skills-Certification-System.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">system</a> of stackable certificates &ndash; has actually led to a deeper, more symbiotic relationship between employers and colleges.</p><p>The growing partnership has also given rise to a blended model of higher education, where the manufacturing industry takes the lead on standards for competency-based education, with a helping hand from colleges, which then provide the traditional degree path.</p><p>For example, Harper College, a community college in Illinois, last month launched a <a href=\"http://goforward.harpercollege.edu/academics/areas/management/mpc.php\" target=\"_blank\">program</a> where students can earn industry-endorsed certificates in manufacturing. And 54 companies have agreed to hire students from the two-year college as paid interns, as soon as students complete the first level certificate, which, at 16 credits, can be earned in less than four months.</p><p>If Harper students thrive in their internships and are able to progress in their manufacturing careers without earning more credentials, everybody wins (except for the college&rsquo;s graduation rate). But even better if students decide to continue their educations and work toward more advanced certificates or degrees.</p><p>This hybrid approach, with both employers and colleges at the table, is a promising way to &ldquo;bridge the worlds of workplace competencies and postsecondary education,&rdquo; Louis Soares, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, wrote in a recent <a href=\"http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2012/06/comp_based_education.html\" target=\"_blank\">report</a>.</p><p><strong>Going It Alone?</strong></p><p>That&rsquo;s not to say that manufacturers and colleges always see eye-to-eye. In fact, many companies feel higher education has failed to create a pipeline of skilled workers. An estimated 600,000 manufacturing jobs are currently unfilled.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re dealing with an industry that has lost a lot of faith in working with education,&rdquo; said Jacey Wilkins, a spokeswoman for the Manufacturing Institute, which is affiliated with the National Association of Manufacturers. In particular, Wilkins said manufacturers have been frustrated with the dismantling of vocational education.</p><p>So the institute decided to take matters into its own hands, and came up with standards for the education of manufacturing employees. The group <a href=\"http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/03/05/certification\" target=\"_blank\">created</a> its manufacturing skills certification system in 2009. The &ldquo;stackable&rdquo; credentials include <a href=\"http://www.themanufacturinginstitute.org/%7E/media/04071088345544D086449F2ABFF99754/Overview.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">four tiers</a> of competency for applicants and veteran employees to demonstrate, ranging from basic aptitude &ndash; like showing that they can get to work on time and work in teams &ndash; to proving that they have high-tech skills in <a href=\"http://www.themanufacturinginstitute.org/%7E/media/8FF9BD4F9136436EABE0CD814D94D5D4/Stackable_Credentials.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">specialized manufacturing fields</a>, like machinery or medical technology.</p><p>The certifications are stackable because they build on each other, with each level presumably having value but also leading to a next step, which can in turn lead to promotions on the job.</p><p>Plenty of praise rolled in for the certification system, including from President Obama. But there&rsquo;s a problem: manufacturers themselves have been slow to recognize the certification, relying on the old standby of college-issued certificates and degrees, many of which do not address the key competencies needed in manufacturing jobs.</p><p>That&rsquo;s where higher education, most notably the University of Phoenix and a growing number of community colleges, has stepped in to give the stackable credential system a fighting chance to become widely accepted.</p><p>The institute&rsquo;s stackable credentials are designed to match up with curriculums at colleges (as well as high schools at the entry level). And in recent months the industry has signed up higher education partners to strengthen those curricular links.</p><p>Phoenix, for example, last year announced a <a href=\"http://www.phoenix.edu/colleges_divisions/business/articles/2011/02/coming-together-to-move-american-manufacturing-forward.html\" target=\"_blank\">new bachelor degree track</a> -- the bachelor of science in management with a <a href=\"http://www.phoenix.edu/colleges_divisions/business/bachelor-of-science-in-management-manufacturing-sector.html\" target=\"_blank\">concentration</a> in manufacturing sector -- that incorporates competencies from the industry&rsquo;s credential system. Soares calls the partnership between Phoenix and the institute a major &ldquo;step up&rdquo; in the development of stackable credentials.</p><p>Creating the new curriculum to align with the certification system wasn&rsquo;t easy, said Tim Welsh, senior vice president for Phoenix&rsquo;s national industry strategy group. It required a substantial financial investment for the university to put faculty members and administrators to work building competencies into the degree program, in a way that met manufacturers&rsquo; needs. As result, Phoenix needed to be sure the final product had value, for both students and employers.</p><p>&ldquo;For us, it keeps the University of Phoenix relevant to the needs of industry,&rdquo; Welsh said. &ldquo;We really do want to get this right.&rdquo;</p><p>Early returns have been positive, with manufacturers backing the degree. And Phoenix doesn&rsquo;t plan to stop with one industry. Welsh said the university is planning to work with national associations for other industries to create similar tailored degrees, with retail, energy, defense and health care as possibilities.</p><p><strong>16-Credit Certificate</strong></p><p>There are 80,000 unfilled manufacturing jobs in Illinois alone, a striking number for a state that has been walloped by the recession&rsquo;s lingering effects.</p><p>That&rsquo;s why Harper College recently sat down with local manufacturers to look for an answer.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to find local solutions to these problems,&rdquo; said Kenneth Ender, president of the college, which is about 30 miles northwest of Chicago.</p><p>Part of the reason companies can&rsquo;t find applicants who are prepared to enter manufacturing is that relatively few college students are interested in the industry, often because they have outdated ideas about it and think the jobs are dirty, menial and probably dead-ends. So the college decided to create a stackable, and portable, <a href=\"http://goforward.harpercollege.edu/academics/areas/management/mpc.php\" target=\"_blank\">system of credentials</a> where students can give manufacturing a whirl and &ldquo;find out if they really like it,&rdquo; Ender said.</p><p>While manufacturing may be a tough sell, the promise of a paid internship helps. College officials worked with industry partners to create an entry-level certificate that gave students enough safety skills and a basic idea of technical measurement and quality control, including some mathematics, so that they could go to work as interns after only one semester of coursework.</p><p>The college also designed several more-specialized <a href=\"http://goforward.harpercollege.edu/academics/areas/management/pdf/18157mfg_chart.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">certificates in four fields</a>: mechatronics/automation, precision machining, metal fabrication and supply chain management. The just-launched program includes at least two certificates in each specialization, which range from 6 to 15 credits to earn.</p><p>There are two further layers in the &ldquo;stack.&rdquo; Students can earn a manufacturing-oriented associate of applied science degree from Harper, or transfer to a four-year institution to pursue a bachelor&rsquo;s degree, perhaps in engineering. The idea is that many students will continue to work in manufacturing jobs while earning their degrees. And Harper has booked articulation agreements on the manufacturing pathway with both Northern Illinois University and Roosevelt University.</p><p>Harper&rsquo;s manufacturing credentials were created to match up with the industry&rsquo;s competency-based skills certification system. Manufacturers served on panels at the college and contributed to the curriculum&rsquo;s design. Ender said some of the companies were not aware of the industry&rsquo;s own stackable system.</p><p>&ldquo;They endorsed it and were amazed that they didn&rsquo;t know about it,&rdquo; he said.</p><p><strong>&#39;Part of the Supply Chain&#39;</strong></p><p>Phoenix and Harper are not alone in partnering with the manufacturing industry. Wilkins said about 115 institutions, mostly two-year colleges, have incorporated elements of the institute&rsquo;s system into academic programs.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re talking about system change here. That doesn&rsquo;t happen overnight,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Eventually we&rsquo;ll get to the point where this is the standard for manufacturing education.&rdquo;</p><p>But the sluggish start for the system has shown that the business sector probably needs higher education to get an alternative credential off the ground. As further proof, few industries are more geared to going it alone than manufacturing.</p><p>Information technology and certified financial planning also are industries where companies and associations issue credentials. But even those two fields have made moves toward credentialing pathways in higher education.

A stunning percentage of those students never graduate. A program at one community college in Brooklyn is trying to tackle the problem head-on from the moment students arrive on campus. NY1&#39;s Lindsey Christ filed the following report.</i></p><p>Community colleges are designed to turn out their graduates in two years. But that rarely happens.</p><p>Case in point: Kingsborough Community College in Brooklyn. After three years, just 25 percent of the students graduate. That is the highest graduation rate of any of the city&#39;s community colleges.</p><p>That&#39;s because more and more students are arriving unprepared for college-level work.</p><p>&quot;These students come from backgrounds where their educational experience, they&#39;ve been very disenfranchised,&quot; said Mary Beth Dawson, a professor at Kingsborough Community College. &quot;They come to us and they have all these hurdles they need to jump in order to graduate and to get through. And these are possible points where they can drop out of the system.&quot;</p><p>10 years ago, the college decided to try something new: put first-year students in groups of 25 and have spend their first semester together, studying English, college skills and a liberal arts class, like theater or sociology. The three professors work together to support the students and weave the courses together.</p><p>Researchers say that one semester raises graduation rates by 4.6 percent.</p><p>&quot;The Learning Communities Program at Kingsborough College is one of the first programs that we&#39;ve studied in higher education that we&#39;ve seen effects on graduation,&quot; said MDRC Research Associate Michael Weiss.</p><p>The college hopes to expand the program even further. Now, about half of first-year students are in learning communities. Administrators anticipate that over the next few years, it could grow to include up to 80 percent of new students.</p><p>&quot;The courses are already being offered,&quot; said Kingsborough Community College Academic Director Marissa Schlesinger. &quot;The courses are already in demand and the faculty want to teach in this.&quot;</p><p>Even though most students arrive needing to take remedial courses in subjects like English and math, administrators at Kingsborough believe that can be discouraging. So this program includes a mix of remedial and college level courses, getting students to catch-up and move forward at the same time. Kingsborough hopes it will also continue to help more of them graduate.</p>','','filtered_html');

Graduates of community colleges and other technical educational programs are well-positioned to provide the kind of workforce that businesses are looking for while earning a good living. In fact, a Sectoral Employment Impact Study found that educational programs with curriculum specifically tailored to employer needs <a href=\"http://www.ppv.org/ppv/publication.asp?section_id=26&amp;search_id=&amp;publication_id=325\">raised earnings by $4,000</a>, and the Brookings Institution&#39;s Metropolitan Policy Program estimates that associate <a class=\"kLink\" href=\"http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/economic-intelligence/2012/07/20/community-colleges-prepare-the-next-generation-of-workers#\" id=\"KonaLink2\" style=\"text-decoration: underline !important;position:static;font-family:inherit !important;font-weight:inherit !important;font-size:inherit !important;\"><font color=\"#005497\" style=\"color: #005497 !important; font-family:inherit !important;font-weight:inherit !important;font-size:inherit !important;position:static;\"><span class=\"kLink\" style=\"color: #005497 !important; font-family:inherit !important;font-weight:inherit !important;font-size:inherit !important;position:static;\">degree </span><span class=\"kLink\" style=\"color: #005497 !important; font-family:inherit !important;font-weight:inherit !important;font-size:inherit !important;position:static;\">holders</span></font></a> <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/research/reports/2009/05/%7E/media/Research/Files/Reports/2009/5/07%20community%20college%20goldrick%20rab/0507_community_college_brief.PDF\">earn 20 to 30 percent more</a> than those with only a high school diploma. There are even some reports that indicate that because these programs provide technical training and practical skills, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/03/community-college-graduat_n_803627.html\">community college graduates earn a higher salary</a>, on average, than graduates of traditional four-year institutions&mdash;up to $10,000 more per year.</p><p>Obviously, it&#39;s not just the students who benefit&mdash;this is also a boon for employers. <a href=\"http://www.aspeninstitute.org/policy-work/aspen-prize/valenciacollege\">Northrup Grumman has started hiring directly from Valencia</a>, allowing them to avoid spending half the year on the road, looking for workers qualified to become laser technicians for military hardware. Career program advisers are embedded in each technical department to help students stay on track and many advisers have had prior experience in the industry, enabling them to keep an eye on career trends and maintain connections that could benefit students.</p><p>Even more traditional universities, including Wake Forest University, Southern Methodist University, and Hiram College, are <a href=\"http://www.cic2020.org/FinalPapers2011/Danielle-Garcia.pdf\">also beginning to incorporate an entrepreneurial focus</a> because it appeals to many students in understanding business and opening opportunities for jobs.</p><p>This is also giving way to institutions that are solely focused on producing &quot;future leaders of a global, free-enterprise society,&quot; <a href=\"https://www.northwood.edu/aboutus/default.aspx\">like Northwood University</a>, which has campuses in Florida, Michigan, and Texas.</p><p>In general, most other countries place <a href=\"http://www.cedefop.europa.eu/en/information-services/vet-in-europe-country-reports.aspx\">far more emphasis on vocational education</a> than we do in America. The logic driving this kind of educational system is that from the later teenage years onward, young people learn best in structured programs that combine work and learning, where learning is contextual and applied. Ultimately, this helps create better jobs and&mdash;more importantly&mdash;a better workforce.&nbsp;</p><p>The American Dream rests on the promise of economic opportunity, with a middle class lifestyle for those willing to work for it. Yet millions of today&#39;s youth are entering the workforce without marketable skills.&nbsp;</p><p>I firmly believe, along with my fellow business leaders at <a href=\"http://www.jobcreatorsalliance.org\">Job Creators Alliance</a>, that the current state of the <a class=\"kLink\" href=\"http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/economic-intelligence/2012/07/20/community-colleges-prepare-the-next-generation-of-workers#\" id=\"KonaLink3\" style=\"text-decoration: underline !important;position:static;font-family:inherit !important;font-weight:inherit !important;font-size:inherit !important;\"><font color=\"#005497\" style=\"color: #005497 !important; font-family:inherit !important;font-weight:inherit !important;font-size:inherit !important;position:static;\"><span class=\"kLink\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 151) ! important; font-family: inherit ! important; font-weight: inherit ! important; font-size: inherit ! important; position: static; border-bottom: 1px solid rgb(0, 84, 151); background-color: transparent;\">American </span><span class=\"kLink\" style=\"color: rgb(0, 84, 151) ! important; font-family: inherit ! important; font-weight: inherit ! important; font-size: inherit ! important; position: static; border-bottom: 1px solid rgb(0, 84, 151); background-color: transparent;\">education</span></font></a> system is on a downward trend and losing sight of the very important goal of preparing students to lead productive and prosperous lives.

INSERT INTO `field_data_body` VALUES ('node','news',0,3501,7997,'und',0,'<p>One-semester learning communities can have long-term benefits for community college students and can even boost graduation rates, according to&nbsp;recently released&nbsp;studies from <a href=\"http://www.mdrc.org/\">MDRC </a>and the <a href=\"http://www.postsecondaryresearch.org/\">National Center for Postsecondary Research</a>.<br /><br />After six years, a one-semester learning community program at <a href=\"http://www.kbcc.cuny.edu/\">Kingsborough Community College</a> (KCC) in New York boosted graduation rates by 4.6 percent, the study reported. That initiative was also found to be cost effective: The cost per degree earned was lower for students in that program than it was for KCC students not in the program.<br /><br /><span class=\"ms-rteStyle-Tagline-Bold\">Modest impact</span><br /><br />Despite those figures, the results of a companion study evaluating a learning community demonstration project that targeted developmental education students found only a modest impact on credits earned in English or mathematics.<br /><br />&ldquo;Implementing learning communities at scale is challenging but possible,&rdquo; MDRC said. &ldquo;Learning communities with high levels of curricular integration are particularly hard to establish and maintain.&rdquo;<br /><br />Learning communities are aimed at boosting persistence by grouping small&nbsp;cohorts of students together in two or more thematically linked courses, usually for a single semester, while they are also given additional academic support. By giving students a chance to form stronger relationships with one another and their instructors,&nbsp;the premise&nbsp;is that&nbsp;they will engage more deeply in learning and thus will be more likely to pass their courses, and ultimately, graduate.<br /><br />KCC&rsquo;s Opening Doors program placed freshmen, most of whom needed developmental English, into groups of up to 25 students. The groups took three classes together during their first semester: English, an academic courses required for the student&rsquo;s major and a freshman orientation course.<br /><br />The evaluation, <a class=\"ms-rteStyle-Italics\" href=\"http://www.mdrc.org/publications/642/overview.html\">Commencement Day: Six-Year Effects of a Freshman Learning Community at Kingsborough Community College</a>, reported that 35.9 percent of students in Opening Doors had earned a degree after six years, compared to 31.3 percent of students in a control group.<br /><br />Students who placed into college-level English when they enrolled were most likely to earn a degree, the study found. But the study also found evidence that the program improved the long-term outcomes of students with the greatest developmental needs in English. The average student in the program earned four more credits over six years than students in the control group.<br /><br />The other report, <a class=\"ms-rteStyle-Italics\" href=\"http://www.mdrc.org/publications/641/overview.html\">The Effects of Learning Communities for Students in Developmental Education</a>, explores the outcomes of six colleges that participated in the learning communities demonstration: the <a href=\"http://ccbcmd.edu/\">Community College of Baltimore County</a> in Maryland, <a href=\"http://www.hccfl.edu/\">Hillsborough Community College</a> in Florida, <a href=\"http://www.hccs.edu/portal/site/hccs\">Houston Community College</a> in Texas, <a href=\"http://www.mccd.edu/\">Merced College</a> in California and <a href=\"http://www.qcc.cuny.edu/\">Queensborough Community College</a> in New York, as well as KCC.<br /><br />Data for the colleges, other than KCC, found those programs&nbsp;had no&nbsp;effect&nbsp;on persistence, a gain of just half a credit earned in the targeted subject (English or math), no effect&nbsp;on credits earned on other subjects and a half-credit effect on total credits earned.<br /><br /><span class=\"ms-rteStyle-Tagline-Bold\">More research needed</span><br /><br />Researchers believe the learning communities at KCC were more effective in the short term because they included a larger number of credits, provided extra academic and counseling support,&nbsp;offered textbook vouchers and targeted students who intended to enroll full time.<br /><br />And while most participating students at KCC required developmental English, about 30 percent were ready for placement into college-level English courses. Finally, that program also received strong institutional support, including professional development opportunities for instructors.<br /><br />Each of those factors might have played a role in the success of the KCC program, MDRC noted, but &ldquo;the research cannot pinpoint which of these features mattered most.&rdquo;<br /><br />In some of the other colleges, the learning communities were not fully integrated with the curriculum, leaving open the question of whether the results would have been more significant if that had been the case.<br /><br />&ldquo;While the research from these studies may not be the final word on learning communities,&rdquo; MDRC said, &ldquo;it nonetheless increases significantly the evidence that colleges, policymakers and funders can use to inform their decisions about whether and how to offer or scale up learning communities in community colleges.&rdquo;</p>','','filtered_html');

According to MDRC:</p><p><strong><em>&ldquo;The Opening Doors Learning Communities program increased the proportion of students who earned a degree by 4.6 percentage points after six years.&rdquo; Additionally, the program is cost-effective, as &ldquo;the cost per degree earned was lower per program group member than it was per control group member.&rdquo;</em></strong></p><p>As most community college reformers know, increasing student learning outcomes is extremely important and extremely difficult. Dr. Regina Peruggi, President of Kingsborough Community College and her team deserve an enormous amount of credit for their innovative reforms. We are pleased to note that ATD&rsquo;s Vice President, Rachel Singer, was an architect and champion of the Opening Doors Learning Community Program and an active reformer at Kingsborough Community College for more than 25 years prior to joining Achieving the Dream as Vice President for Community College Relations and Applied Research. Rachel and her Kingsborough colleagues have clearly demonstrated that student access can be translated into student success and completion when college leadership commits to student-centered reforms.</p><p>Please join me in congratulating Kingsborough Community College for being an exemplar of equity and excellence.</p>','','filtered_html');

Students who do poorly on the tests are usually placed in developmental, or remedial, education. In fact, about 60 percent of high-school graduates who enroll at two-year colleges have to take remedial courses. But a rash of recent studies has started to cast a doubt on the effectiveness of placement tests and their role in higher education.</p><p>&quot;Where to Begin? The Evolving Role of Placement Exams for Students Starting College,&quot; released Tuesday by Jobs for the Future, a nonprofit organization that studies education and work-force issues, explores how institutions and even states are grappling with this issue and the decisions they are making to ensure that their students graduate.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.jff.org/sites/default/files/u3/ATD_WhereToBegin_073112.pdf\">The report</a> highlights emerging research that has begun to challenge long-held notions about how well placement tests work in determining college readiness. One of the more striking revelations in the report is research from the Community College Research Center that found that the grades high-school students earn is a better predictor of how well they will do in college than the scores they receive on a placement test.</p><p>&quot;Up to one-third of students were found to be &#39;severely misassigned&#39; using placement-test results, and that error rate could be reduced in half by using high-school grades instead of test scores,&quot; the report says of the research center&#39;s findings.</p><p>The report also highlights research that shows &quot;that students who are placed into developmental classes have a very low likelihood of ever completing college.&quot;</p><p>Such findings are of concern because it makes the task of graduating more students that much harder.</p><p>College placement exams tend to test students&#39; knowledge on math and English only. But there is a growing interest among college educators and policy makers in the role that &quot;psychosocial or noncognitive&quot; factors, such as &quot;academic persistence and motivation,&quot; play in college-readiness, and those perhaps should be tested as well, the report says.</p><h4 class=\"CHE-5-column-News subhead\">Shifting Priorities</h4><p>Numerous states have begun to make changes on how they gauge students&#39; readiness for college-level course work. Those efforts cover a variety of approaches, such as de-emphasizing placement tests, tailoring or replacing the tests altogether, and preparing students better for the tests.</p><p>Some colleges, like those in New Jersey, have begun to use high-school grades as an &quot;additional measure for students who score just above or below the cutoff score,&quot; the report says. Austin Community College, in Texas, is evaluating student essays as a way &quot;to refine placement decisions for scores in the gray zone,&quot; it says.</p><p>Those are examples of community colleges that are putting less emphasis on placement tests.</p><p>Florida and Virginia have commissioned &quot;customized&quot; placement tests that would align better with their states&#39; curricula.</p><p>Meanwhile, Texas is working with the College Board to include a &quot;diagnostic profile&quot; in its tailor-made assessment that would describe &quot;each student&#39;s strengths and weaknesses for use by advisers and instructors,&quot; the report says.</p><p>Faculty have long argued that the current crop of placement tests just provide cutoff scores and that more information is needed to help students, the report says.</p>','','filtered_html');
INSERT INTO `field_data_body` VALUES ('node','news',0,3534,8113,'und',0,'<p>On Tuesday, <a href=\"http://www.jff.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jobs for the Future (JFF)</a>, a non-profit organization that aligns education with today&rsquo;s high demand careers, released a <a href=\"http://www.jff.org/sites/default/files/ATD_WhereToBegin_073112.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">report</a> reevaluating the efficiency of college placement exams because of its negative effects on schools, like <a class=\"inline_link\" href=\"http://www.examiner.com/topic/coppin-state/articles\">Coppin State</a>. JFF&rsquo;s report, &ldquo;Where to Begin? The Evolving Role of Placement Exams for Students Starting in College,&rdquo; stated that those students placed in remedial courses, as a result of the exam, are usually deterred from their academic track and contribute heavily to their school&#39;s high retention rates.</p><p>Schools like Coppin State, who struggle with low retention rates, tend to place a higher value on placement exams. Since the exams are supposed to predict a student&rsquo;s readiness for college-level courses, administration seriously considers low or &ldquo;cut-off&rdquo; scores in order to advise class schedules for incoming freshman. For Coppin, any student who has a SAT score exceeding 470 in math or verbal are exempt from taking the placement assessment. However, the highest average score for incoming Coppin students is 460 on both the math and verbal section of the SAT <a href=\"http://www.collegeview.com/schools/coppin-state-university/testscores\" rel=\"nofollow\">(College View)</a>. As a result, most incoming Coppin freshman are obligated to take the placement exam and have a first-year schedule filled with remedial and developmental courses.</p><p>The JFF reports this practice as problematic because enforcing remedial or developmental courses can disrupt a student&rsquo;s academic trail. Pamela Burden, author of JFF&rsquo;s report, revealed a study of student performance in remedial courses and its effect on their future success.</p><p>&ldquo;A study by CCRC (Commission on Rehabilitation Counselor Certification) found that nearly one-third of students assigned to developmental education did not complete their developmental sequence because they never enrolled in a developmental course&mdash;not because they could not handle the coursework. Roughly another 10 percent&mdash;students who were required to take more than one developmental course&mdash;passed at least one course but did not take the next course in the sequence,&rdquo;</p><p>Based on this study Burden suggested, &ldquo;placement into a remedial course and in particular a sequence of courses may have a significant impact on students&rsquo; trajectories by placing additional hurdles in their way.&rdquo;</p><p>In addition to deterring a student&rsquo;s trajectory, the JFF report also highlighted that the exam scores oftentimes fail to accurately diagnose a student&rsquo;s readiness for college. Instead, studies show that high school grades serve as a more accurate barometer of a student&rsquo;s aptitude. Burden predicted, &ldquo;high school grades used alone would increase the success rates of those going directly into college-level courses, reduce the severe error rates in terms of students who appear under-placed, and increase rates of immediate college-level success.&rdquo;</p><p>In going forward, the JFF report suggested for schools to reconsider the role of generic placement tests and replace them with program-specific placement. According to JFF, students not in science and math related fields should not have to waste time in sequential math or science development courses. Burden commented, &ldquo;The relatively high proportion of students requiring math remediation and the relatively low rates of success in these courses combine to make placement in developmental math one of the biggest barriers to successful college completion.&rdquo;</p><p>JFF continues their research on a new, customized exam that could ameliorate the success for students attending schools structured like Coppin State.</p>','','filtered_html');

The Evolving Role Of Placement Exams For Students Starting College&rdquo;</a> &ndash;- was produced by Jobs for the Future, a Boston, Mass.-based education policy group that is one of several nonprofits working to dramatically increase the number of low-income youth and adults who attain a post-secondary credential over the next decade.</p><p>A college placement exam critic as well as a representative from the maker of a commonly-used college placement exam both said the report represents a timely look at an area of higher education that is overdue for reform.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been advocating for almost everything that&rsquo;s been indicated in the report for quite a few years now,&rdquo; said David Parmele, executive director in the ACCUPLACER program for the College Board.</p><p>The ACCUPLACER is a college placement exam produced by the College Board.</p><p>&ldquo;We do not believe that the placement score alone should be the only factor used to decide a student&rsquo;s placement into college-level classes,&rdquo; Parmele said, echoing a key aspect of the report&mdash;namely, how some systems are weighing the merits of moving away from the widespread practice of using the test scores as the only basis for assigning students to remedial classes and toward using multiple measures, such as high school grades.</p><p>Dr. Ling-Chi Wang, Professor Emeritus in Asian American Studies at UC Berkeley and a longtime critic of college placement exams, also praised the report.</p><p>&ldquo;I thought it was high time somebody raised this issue and questioned the validity and the quality of the effectiveness and, in some cases, the abuse of remedial tests to sometimes prevent people from moving forward academically or even prevent people from getting admitted (to college),&rdquo; Wang said.</p><div class=\"divArticleContent\" id=\"ArticleContent\"><p>Wang said college placement tests tend to hurt immigrant and low-income students the most by keeping them out of college or landing them in a series of burdensome non-credit-bearing remedial education courses, despite the fact that research has shown students can be remediated within the framework of regular credit-bearing courses.</p><p>&ldquo;Everybody knows that your test score is really directly correlated with your income and, of course, your immigration status,&rdquo; Wang said. &ldquo;Those are the most important factors in deciding whether you pass all theses tests or not.&rdquo;</p><p>The report&rsquo;s author, Pamela Burdman, a Chicago-based consultant on issues of college readiness and success, said the report is meant to provoke discussion on the usefulness of college placement tests at a time when greater emphasis is being placed on the value of a college degree and when research is showing that remedial education is often ineffective.</p><p>&ldquo;I think high stakes decisions are being made about students&rsquo; futures on the basis of fairly thin evidence,&rdquo; Burdman said, amplifying one of the key points of her report. &ldquo;I think the field is moving more in the direction of finding ways to give students the benefit of the doubt. In other words, if their exam score is low but their grades are high, do we find a way to interpret that so that this student can be successful?&rdquo;</p><p>She continued: &ldquo;If our goal is trying to help students get to a degree, a lot of colleges are saying, &lsquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t we be trying these approaches to help students get to these points,&rsquo; rather than saying, &lsquo;We need to enforce these standards and I don&rsquo;t know if these students are up to snuff.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>Although the report is largely directed at community colleges, it has implications for four-year institutions as well, Burdman said.</p><p>The report cites some of the latest research in the field and gives examples of higher education systems that are wrestling with how to make the best use of college placement exams.</p><p>It also deals with the merits of alternative approaches, from downplaying the tests by reducing reliance on placement scores, to &ldquo;mainstreaming&rdquo; students into regular classes with support&mdash;a practice that the report says evidence has shown can potentially work with some students whose test scores are below the cutoff.</p><p>The report also gives a nod to the &ldquo;tradeoffs and tensions&rdquo; associated with changing the status quo. One such tension concerns the battle between effectiveness and efficiency&mdash;the latter being one of the hallmarks of using a single test and a cutoff score as opposed to other methods that involve more discretion.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s still a place for (college placement exams) but they need to be used in the right combination with all of these other factors,&rdquo; the College Board&rsquo;s Parmele said. &ldquo;No one&rsquo;s found that secret formula as to what works best.&rdquo;</p><p>Burdman conceded similar thoughts.</p><p>&ldquo;One of the reasons colleges rely on placement exams in the first place is [that] it&rsquo;s efficient and transparent,&rdquo; Burdman said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s sort of seen as fair, whereas, if you start introducing a more complex system, it takes more staff time and more money, which many colleges just don&rsquo;t have.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Secondly, it opens up the opportunity for people to question the fairness,&rdquo; Burdman said of moving away from rigid cutoff scores and toward more flexibility and discretion.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do think college systems are being very cautious about this because they don&rsquo;t want to wade into an area where they&rsquo;re seen as using an amount of discretion that leads to unfairness or inequality.&rdquo;</p></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>','','filtered_html');

Achieving the Dream is a nonprofit group located in Silver Springs, Maryland, focused on improving graduation rates for community college students. The group targets the college&#39;s administration and gives them the support and resources they need to raise graduation rates.</p><p>&quot;This is the first time we&#39;ve had students involved in the kickoff,&quot; said Mia Ramos, Achieving the Dream&#39;s Assistant Director of Programs for New Colleges. &quot;It was incredibly inspiring to see the energy and the motivation of these students behind this initiative.&quot;</p><p>Participating in the kickoff were Mari Cobb, Patty Neary and Justin Roth, Tillamook Bay Community College; Dean Dier, Megan Romero and Maggie Towel, Klamath Community College; and Jessica Roden and Lacy Timlick, Columbia Gorge Community College.</p><p>The students participated in a board game developed by Achieving the Dream to emulate the experience of the college student. Ramos said the presence of the students brought a new perspective to the kickoff, inspiring both Achieving the Dream officials and community college administrators to think even more about student engagement. As Phi Theta Kappa members, these students were already involved with completion efforts on their college campuses through the Community College Completion Corps initiative, a grass-roots campaign aimed at encouraging their college&#39;s students to commit to completing a college credential.</p><p>&quot;We wanted students who are more involved with the work that&#39;s being done at their college,&quot; Ramos said. &quot;As a Phi Theta Kappa (alumna) member, I knew Phi Theta Kappa students would be the best students for us to work with.&quot;</p><p>Ramos also served Phi Theta Kappa as International Vice President for Division I.</p><p>Achieving the Dream leads a network of nearly 200 institutions, more than 100 coaches and advisors and 15 state policy teams - working throughout 32 states and the District of Columbia - to help 3.75 million community college students have a better chance at completing their degree or certificate. The 2012 Cohort added 26 community colleges to this network.</p><p>College administrators participating in the cohort meet with leadership and data coaches to help determine their achievement gaps.</p><p>Learn more about the Community College Completion Corps and how your chapter can participate online at <a href=\"http://www.cccompletioncorps.org/\">cccompletioncorps.org</a>.</p></div></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>','','filtered_html');

Many community colleges are on this path and have developed and implemented successful student success initiatives that have proven to raise student achievement.

When faculty saw their success rates, they began to experiment with new ways of teaching and structuring courses. Policy changes such as the no late registration policy were watershed moments for the college as we made a cultural shift from an access-centric institution to an access and success focus. Another hallmark of our ATD work was the creation of the Center for Teaching and Learning, which has provided professional development on topics including student engagement, diversity in the classroom, and increasing student success and completion.</p></blockquote><p>DEI initiatives such as math modules, accelerated English and early support in high school helped accelerate students&rsquo; progress through developmental education.</p><p>With Completion by Design, Sinclair and other Ohio community colleges hope to &ldquo;create a seamless pathway&rdquo; to graduation for students.</p>','','filtered_html');

INSERT INTO `field_data_body` VALUES ('node','news',0,3594,8289,'und',0,'<p><a href=\"http://www.communitycollegereview.com/articles/147\">Placement tests</a> have traditionally been used by community colleges nationwide to determine whether <a href=\"http://www.communitycollegereview.com/articles/28\">recent high school graduates are prepared for the rigors of college coursework</a>. The results of these examinations has landed many incoming college freshman into remedial or &ldquo;developmental&rdquo; classes designed to bring their academic skills up to par before embarking on more challenging college-level classes. However, recent evidence suggests that those <a href=\"http://www.communitycollegereview.com/articles/474\">remedial classes</a> may be having a much larger &ndash; and negative &ndash; influence on <a href=\"http://www.communitycollegereview.com/articles/297\">college completion rates</a> overall. Additional research has shown that these placement examinations may not even be the most accurate assessment of college readiness for the majority of students today.</p><p><strong>College Placement Exams Study: Other Measurements More Accurate?</strong></p><p>A new <a href=\"http://www.achievingthedream.org/resource/where_to_begin_the_evolving_role_of_placement_exams_for_students_starting_college\">study from Achieving the Dream</a>, a non-profit organization, was created to improve <a href=\"http://www.communitycollegereview.com/articles/281\">community college outcomes for low-income students</a>. The study, titled, &ldquo;Where to Begin? The Evolving Role of Placement Exams for Students Starting College,&rdquo; found that tests commonly used by colleges to determine incoming student placement may be inaccurate and create hurdles to student success in college. The study found that other factors, including high school grades, may be better measures of success.</p><p>The study looked at students from the Long Beach Unified school district that attended <a href=\"http://www.communitycollegereview.com/school_overview/146\">Long Beach City College</a> after high school. The study found that ninety percent of the students had to take five semester or more of <a href=\"http://www.communitycollegereview.com/articles/219\">remedial classes</a> before they could embark on their college coursework. The study also found that if the college had relied on grade point averages, rather than placement exam scores, to allow freshmen to move right into college curriculum, the number of freshmen in college classes would have risen by as much as 500 percent.</p><p>&ldquo;With educational reformers keenly focused on remedial education, new research using longitudinal data systems questions the efficacy and fairness of the very tests on which the system of remedial education relies,&rdquo; Pamela Burdman, author of the study, was reported as saying at EdSource. Burdman added that the results of this study were so &ldquo;stunning,&rdquo; additional studies will soon be launched on 22 <a href=\"http://www.communitycollegereview.com/articles/418\">community colleges within the state of California</a>.</p><p><strong>Placement Exams and Completion Rates</strong></p><p>For many years, the issue of placement examinations was not addressed because educators did not link these examinations to overall college completion rates. However, with <a href=\"http://www.communitycollegereview.com/articles/357\">increased focus on completion</a>, schools are now forced to take a look at whether remedial education has an impact on the number of students that actually go on to complete their degree programs. As that link began to be studied, it became apparent that there was a direct association between students that had to take multiple remedial courses and those that never finished their college degree.</p><p>According to <a href=\"http://californiawatch.org/dailyreport/community-college-students-vexed-placement-tests-5845\">California Watch</a>, only 25 percent of students that are required to take remedial reading courses in community college ever moved to a transfer-level English course. By the same token, only 10 percent of students taking a <a href=\"http://www.communitycollegereview.com/articles/205\">remedial math class</a> ever moved to a college-level course. For schools that already feature a dismal completion rate of around 30 percent, the impact of remedial coursework could profoundly affect those numbers.</p><p>The study reported in the California Watch found many potential problems with college placement examinations, including exam inconsistency from school to school and lack of preparation and awareness of exams by students. Many students didn&rsquo;t realize they had to take the tests and did not prepare for them ahead of time. Even after completing exams, a number of students didn&rsquo;t realize how much impact those scores would have on their overall community college experience.</p><p><strong>Five Challenges to Placement Exams</strong></p><p>The study by Achieve the Dream categorized five elements that result in the problems with the placement exams as they are today:</p><ul><li><strong>High Stakes</strong> &ndash; These placement examinations are currently seen as low-stakes exams, so students are unaware of the repercussions if they don&rsquo;t perform well on the tests.</li><li><strong>Effectiveness of Developmental Education</strong> &ndash; The study also suggests the developmental, or remedial, education in its current state may be an ineffective tool in improving college success.</li><li><strong>Positive Indications</strong> &ndash; Early studies seem to suggest that allowing students to accelerate through remedial education &ndash; or skip it entirely &ndash; could improve student outcomes.</li><li><strong>Poor Indicators</strong> &ndash; Studies also suggest that placement examinations are poor indicators of academic success, and that other measuring tools may be more effective.</li><li><strong>Incomplete Picture</strong> &ndash; Placement examinations may not provide a complete picture of potential student success, since they don&rsquo;t accurately measure intangibles like persistence, motivation and critical thinking skills.</li></ul><p><strong>Hope for the Future</strong></p><p>Fortunately, in the midst of much bleak news on placement exams, there is a bright spot in the recent study. Researchers also looked at ways to change the system to make it more accurate and conducive to increased completion rates. Some states are also becoming <a href=\"http://www.communitycollegereview.com/articles/279\">innovative in the way they approach college readiness</a>. For example, <a href=\"http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/curriculum/2012/08/how_valuable_are_college_place.html\">Education Week</a> reports that North Carolina is now working with College Board to design a new type of interactive exam that will better reflect the curriculum taught in the state.</p><p>New Jersey has plans to factor high school grades into examination scores. A community college is Texas is also using a similar system for students that fall into the &ldquo;grey&rdquo; zone of college readiness. Other schools are trying new ideas like providing online study guides for placement exams and offering remedial coursework in tandem with college classes for students that do require additional help.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.communitycollegereview.com/articles/394\">College readiness</a> is an important factor in college success, but measuring readiness is an imperfect process. Perhaps research like this will help educators find the most effective ways for measuring readiness to provide students with the best chance of success in the future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>','','filtered_html');

Starting positions for associate degree holders may include desktop support, Microsoft networking, and Cisco networking administration.</p><p>&quot;All of our degrees and certificates in this area prepare a student for immediate employment,&quot; said Kent. &quot;In the networking field, a certificate of technology or a two-year associate degree is the entry-level credential needed to land a good paying job.&quot;</p><p>Many computer technology positions far surpass the national average growth rate for occupations, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Kent said companies often call him looking to hire students for positions such as desktop support, network administration, and help desk. Starting salaries can range from $35,000 to $45,000.</p><p>However, with an associate degree education that cost him around $6,000, Funderburk said he was able to obtain a job that pays for all of his tuition plus a comfortable living in downtown Houston.</p><p>&quot;Community college gave me the skills and knowledge to sell myself for the position I have now, and my professors helped prepare me for the real-world working environment,&quot; he said. &quot;Employers like to see that you&#39;re trying to better yourself, that you&#39;re a student who is achieving a higher education.&quot;</p><p>With one degree already bringing him success, Funderburk isn&#39;t stopping there. He said he plans to pursue his bachelor&#39;s and master&#39;s degrees at the University of Houston College of Technology while also continuing his work as a systems administrator.</p>','','filtered_html');

In Virginia, the average state funding per student at community colleges fell 36 percent, from $4,602 to $2,946, between 2006 and 2011. And, in the last four years, demand for community college education in California has increased while the budgets have been cut by 12 percent. Many institutions nationwide cite such hurdles to justify three-year graduation rates dipping as low as 15 percent, saying it&rsquo;s impossible to do better. But that&rsquo;s not true.</p><p>Even in the face of all the challenges, there are examples of community colleges doing a superb job achieving student success at scale on campuses across the country. The sector is inventing programs that show promising results, yet community colleges are still being recognized more for their challenges than their successes. What community colleges need is a better sense of where to look for examples of excellence in the sector in order to raise the bar, not only for college completion, but also for student learning outcomes and employment after college.</p><p>In July, the Aspen Institute published data that offer some pointers on where to look for solutions. Performance and improvement metrics were released that detail which 120 community colleges are doing best -- and improving the most -- in terms of graduation rates, retention rates and degrees awarded, for all students and for minority populations that have historically performed at lower levels. The data are used to determine the top U.S. community colleges that are eligible for the 2013 Aspen Prize for Community College Excellence.</p><p>The data set Aspen released, which is based on the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), does not tell the whole story, but it tells an important one. It shows community colleges across the country what levels of student success are possible, as well as some places they ought to look to as models. For example, the data show that:</p><ul><li>Walla Walla Community College (Wash.) boasts a 54 percent three-year graduation and transfer rate, well above the national average of 40 percent.</li><li>Santa Barbara City College (Calif.) has a three-year graduation and transfer rate of 48 percent for Hispanic students, which make up over 30 percent of its student body.</li><li>Lake Area Technical Institute (S.D.) has a three-year graduation and transfer rate of 76 percent, even though over 40 percent of its students are low-income enough to be receiving Pell grants.</li></ul><p>Not every example on this list of 120 is relevant to every community college. But every two-year college in the country can find examples in the Aspen data set of a place that looks a lot like they do, yet is achieving higher levels of student graduation, or retention, or degrees awarded, or minority student success. They can then work to figure out what those colleges are doing that allowed them to be so successful and examine the programs that are working well -- helping students learn, complete programs and obtain degrees.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, even after consecutive years of budget cuts in California, Santa Barbara City College has maintained an excellent range of programs to improve student success, including an accelerated track that helps speed the neediest students through developmental math and an exceptional writing center that prepares students for the rigors of upper-division classes if and when they transfer to a four-year college. Walla Walla Community College has developed very strong systems for advising students to ensure that they complete degrees, employing quarterly advising by case managers and excellent online tools to monitor progress towards credentials with strong labor market value. Lake Area Technical Institute also prevents students from slipping through the cracks by enrolling all students in cohort-based, block-scheduled programs, where students progress together through each semester knowing exactly what courses, degree and career lie ahead.</p><p>Valencia College, the winner of the first Aspen Prize in 2011, achieved its 51 percent three-year graduation rate with a highly diverse student population &ndash; 46 percent of its students are Hispanic or African-American. While many significant and scaled initiatives have contributed to Valencia&rsquo;s exceptional student outcomes, the college&rsquo;s success is built in substantial part on a culture of learning among professors and staff, fueled by a completely revamped tenure process that rewards professors for improving their teaching.</p><p>These institutions, as well as the others on the list of 120, have awakened to the realities that we cannot continue to deliver higher education in the same way we always have in this country and expect better student outcomes. And, community college outcomes need to improve. The national full-time graduation rate of 28 percent is unacceptably low, and student success rates remain under 40 percent even if you count students who transfer to a four-year college without ever completing community college. And, as has been widely reported, graduation rates are even lower for the large number students who enter community college needing remedial education.</p><p>But understanding the need to improve is only the first step. By examining the quantitative outcomes of the 120 colleges on this list, all community colleges should be able to understand that much higher levels of student success are possible. Aspen will help over the coming year by releasing toolkits and providing briefings about what is happening at the 10 finalist community colleges vying for the 2013 prize -- which were just <a href=\"http://www.aspeninstitute.org/policy-work/aspen-prize/2013finalists\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a>. Our hope is that increasing amounts of attention will be paid to these exemplars of student success, and that more and more people will recognize them as excellent, deserving of our investments and places that offer institution-wide solutions to the challenges community colleges face.</p></div></div></div></div></div><p>&nbsp;</p>','','filtered_html');

Many community colleges are on this path and have developed and implemented promising student success initiatives and realized increased student success outcomes. Though these colleges are making great progress, it is difficult to spread these effective practices to other community colleges so that more students can benefit from these interventions and so our nation can reach our education and workforce goals.</p><p>&quot;At TG, we recognize that leadership matters,&rdquo;&nbsp;said Jacob Fraire,&nbsp;Vice President of Student and Institutional Success&nbsp;at&nbsp;TG. &nbsp;&ldquo;We are fortunate that Texas has a great core of Leader Colleges from which we can build a knowledge infrastructure for achieving success for all community college students.&nbsp;&nbsp;TG is pleased to serve as a funding and thought partner&nbsp;with Achieving the Dream on this very important initiative to spread effective practices throughout the state of Texas.&quot;</p><p>Lessons learned from these colleges will inform the development of an Achieving the Dream peer coaching framework for college-to-college coaching that will advance the student success movement in Texas and across the nation. &nbsp;</p><p>Representatives from the seven selected colleges, Achieving the Dream, Inc., and TG will convene for an inaugural Texas Peer Coaching Initiative Kickoff Institute at Austin Community College in Austin, TX&nbsp;on September 25, 2012 from&nbsp;10 a.m. to 3 p.m. &nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>Achieving the Dream Leader Colleges</em></strong></p><p>Leader Colleges are demonstrating the power of the Achieving the Dream Student-Centered Model of Institutional Improvement. They show that it is possible to raise persistence and graduation rates, close achievement gaps, and improve lives. Leader Colleges embody the ultimate goal of Achieving the Dream, and as such, serve as mentors within a community of learners. To be eligible for Leader College distinction, colleges must demonstrate commitment to and progress on the Achieving the Dream principles: committed leadership, use of evidence to improve programs and services, broad engagement, and systemic institutional improvement. They must also show three years of sustained improvement of student success on at least one of the following measures of performance:</p><ul><li style=\"margin-left: 0.5in; \">Completion of certificates or degrees</li><li style=\"margin-left: 0.5in; \">Term-to-term and year-to-year retention</li><li style=\"margin-left: 0.5in; \">Completion of college-level math and English courses</li><li style=\"margin-left: 0.5in; \">Advancement from developmental to credit-bearing courses</li><li style=\"margin-left: 0.5in; \">Course completion</li></ul><p>Additionally, each Leader College has successfully implemented at least one student success intervention or initiative that is advancing student outcomes that are of sufficient scale to benefit a substantial proportion of students. Indeed, these institutions have met high standards of practice and performance and Achieving the Dream expects these colleges to serve as mentors within the Achieving the Dream community of learners.

It&rsquo;s a chance to hear from students regardless of age, economic background, ethnicity, culture, and history about what&rsquo;s driving them and keeping them on track to their dream job.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re excited to be partnering with Achieving the Dream to challenge community college students around the country to dream big.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re big believers in the power of storytelling and it&rsquo;s ability to drive social impact and there&rsquo;s no better way to capture inspiring stories on education than from students themselves,&rdquo; said Rei Wang, Strategic Partnerships Manager at GOOD.&nbsp;</p><p>Interested students should go to <a href=\"http://dreambig.maker.good.is/\">http://dreambig.maker.good.is/</a> for contest rules, eligibility guidelines, and submission instructions. <strong>Submission Deadline is Noon PST, Tuesday, November 13, 2012</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>DREAM Big for College and Your Future, Call for Student Video Entries</strong> is part of a larger Achieving the Dream student-centered campaign that includes a previous video contest and T-shirt contest in early 2012, followed by other exciting student-oriented calls for action.&nbsp; DREAM Big for College, is a property of Achieving the Dream.</p><p><strong><em>Achieving the Dream, Inc.</em></strong><br />Achieving the Dream, Inc. is a national nonprofit that is dedicated to helping more community college students, particularly low-income students and students of color, stay in school and earn a college certificate or degree.

INSERT INTO `field_data_body` VALUES ('node','news',0,3866,8988,'und',0,'<p>Why is <em>remedial</em> or <em>developmental</em> education such a hot issue? Partly because it costs time and money and casts doubt on the elementary and secondary education systems that we assume will prepare students for college.</p><p>The New England Board of Higher Education (NEBHE) explored solutions to the problem at a recent forum in Kennebunkport, Maine, called &ldquo;Ready for Real: Innovative Strategies for Improving Remedial Education and College Success.&rdquo;</p><p>NEBHE staff briefed the audience of educators, legislators and policymakers on the recent Lumina Foundation for Education <a href=\"http://www.nebhe.org/newslink/nebhe-awarded-lumina-foundation-for-education-grant-to-work-with-khan-academy-to-boost-remedial-math/\">grant</a> the regional organization received to support community colleges implementing Khan Academy materials in developmental math courses. NEBHE also released a <a href=\"http://www.nebhe.org/info/pdf/events/boardmeetings/sept2012/NEBHE-Policy_Snapshot_Increasing_College_Readiness.pdf\">policy brief</a> outlining college placement policies across the region and models for boosting college readiness.</p><p><strong>Rethinking developmental ed</strong></p><p>Many colleges use the College Board&rsquo;s Accuplacer test to determine whether students are ready for credit-bearing college courses or first need to take and pass one or more remedial classes.</p><p>In a session on &ldquo;Rethinking Developmental Education: State and Institutional Perspectives,&rdquo;<strong> </strong>Lara Couturier, program director at Jobs for the Future, offered a national context for remediation. She noted that 60% of community college students were referred into developmental education programs&mdash;<em>Dev Ed</em> as she called it. Once there, most never progressed into college-credit-bearing work, and only one-quarter earned a college degree within eight years.</p><p>A historian by training, Couturier spoke about different developmental education models, including some involving long sequences of courses with too many exit points where students are tempted to drop out&mdash;and too often do. Some call Dev Ed the place where college dreams go to die. Others, Couturier among them, believe it should be looked at in a more holistic way, as an &ldquo;on-ramp to a structured pathway to graduation.&rdquo; Virginia has been a leader in a wave of states redesigning developmental education, followed by North Carolina and Florida. Another promising model is the <a href=\"http://cap.3csn.org/\">California Acceleration Project</a>, which aims to reduce the number of exit points.</p><p>Some models involve partnering with local K-12 districts, so students&rsquo; skills can be assessed in their junior year of high school. If at the point, the students are deemed not college-ready, they can take remedial courses while still in high school. Others make developmental education a <em>co-requisite&mdash;</em>a formal course taken <em>simultaneously</em> with another as opposed to a prerequisite. The Community College of Baltimore County, for example, places developmental students into college-level English but also supports them with an hour-long companion course.</p><p>Couturier noted that the placement tests that have been relied upon historically may not be the good predictors of success we thought they were. She also urged aligning development education with the student&rsquo;s major and career interest. The spotlight, she suggested, should shift to getting development education students into programs of study, which means more intentional and frequent <em>advising.</em></p><p>Couturier also noted a dearth of efforts to help students who are <em>severely</em> underprepared.</p><p><strong>Feed me data</strong></p><p>Norwalk Community College President David Levinson, who is also vice president for Community Colleges with the Connecticut Board of Regents for Higher Education, said he was amazed by how <em>little</em> Connecticut relied on data when he came aboard in 2004. Indeed, a self-study for the&nbsp; New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC) had not a single bit of data. Then <a href=\"http://www.achievingthedream.org/\">Achieving the Dream</a> came along and brought to bear the purpose of research, Levinson said.</p><p>Norwalk Community College has tried blending college-level courses and developmental courses in &quot;learning communities&quot; but that was with just over a dozen students. The question, said Levinson, is how do you bring that to scale?</p><p>Today, such issues are being overshadowed in Connecticut by legislation calling for all remediation to be confined to a one-semester, intensive course&mdash;not as a sequence. &ldquo;We are faced with the really daunting task of not only a new structure that is not even a year old (the state&#39;s new Board of Regents for Higher Education) but also&nbsp;this humungous task of trying to implement a piece of legislation that doesn&rsquo;t have a penny attached to it,&quot; said Levinson.</p><p>He noted that Connecticut acknowledges enrollment &lsquo;swirling,&rsquo; and students starting at one school, taking some courses at another, and going on to get not only an associate degree but perhaps a bachelor&rsquo;s and master&rsquo;s. Levinson said that even at his college on Connecticut&rsquo;s euphemistically named &ldquo;Gold Coast,&rdquo; 83% of students from Norwalk and Stamford need at least one precollege course. What politicians see in all this, he said, is the state paying for remedial education twice&mdash;in high school and college&mdash;and the students still are not succeeding.</p><p>Nashua Community College President Lucille Jordan said she was asked by the New Hampshire Legislature to identify which students needed developmental education and which high schools they came from. Problem was, she said, many have been out of high school for a long time.</p><p>Besides, what would have been a good enough score in math at one time no longer is. Nashua Community College uses <a href=\"http://professionals.collegeboard.com/higher-ed/placement/accuplacer/diagnostics\" target=\"_blank\">Accuplacer Diagnostics</a>, providing a detailed analysis of a student&#39;s strengths and weaknesses, so students can focus on the areas where they are weak. Jordan also called for embedding reading and study skills in 100-level courses. She acknowledged that many students may need tutors to stay with them through college-level coursework.</p><p>Community College of Vermont President Joyce Judy said the Vermont Legislature has chosen not to get involved in the developmental skills arena <em>per se</em>, focusing more on dual enrollment and multiple pathways.</p><p>&ldquo;We have one shot with those students and if we&rsquo;re not successful in helping them engage and feel like it&rsquo;s relevant to them, we&rsquo;ve lost them for another 10 or 15 years,&rdquo; said Judy. Some students need a 15-week basic skills course; others need something different. We&rsquo;re asking if Accuplacer is nuanced enough to see where strengths and weaknesses are, she said. She noted that the college is asking developmental English students to do a self-assessment, not of their skills, but of their practices, asking for example, if they read newspapers and magazines regularly.</p><p>&ldquo;One size does not fit all,&rdquo; said Judy. In developmental math, the Community College of Vermont is developing a one-credit, self-paced tutorial, which Judy says, &ldquo;students could realistically move through in three weeks.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s a challenge, she noted, for institutions that like to go with 15-week courses that are easier to manage, but just don&rsquo;t work for all students.</p><p>Several attendees said the Dev Ed conversation should not deal so much with <em>repairing</em> vs. <em>preparing</em>. Many believe the <a href=\"http://www.corestandards.org/\">Common Core State Standards</a> will help with preparation, but there will always be adult learners who need some kind of remediation perhaps via new models such as massive open online courses (MOOCs).</p><p><strong>Sharing strategies</strong></p><p>Developmental education can be improved, but not eradicated, warned Rhode Island College President Nancy Carriuolo. For one thing, Dev Ed is not just remediation, but actually covers a wide range of learning needs exhibited by all learners. Thomas Edison today would have probably been placed in remediation,&nbsp;Carriuolo asserted, because of his deficiencies in reading and writing.</p><p>&ldquo;Policymakers often don&rsquo;t know firsthand the distractions low-income students have&mdash;families to support, drug or alcohol problems, low self-esteem and the cumulative effect that comes from not doing well in school,&quot; Carriuolo said, adding: &quot;Notice in that brief list, I didn&rsquo;t say anything about poor teaching.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We need to think carefully about what will happen to the most underprepared students who are turned away from community colleges,&quot; Carriuolo reflected. &quot;Will they enter adult basic education to learn the basic skills they need &hellip; will they enter a training program someplace else or will they simply go home to their couches, a bag of potato chips and a life sustained by a welfare check?&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Solving the math problem?</strong></p><p>At Housatonic Community College, students who went through developmental English passed the gatekeeper college English at a 20% higher rate than those who tested straight into the course without the detour, said President Anita Gliniecki. But math was completely opposite, she said. Even if you got through the developmental math, your potential to succeed was at least 10% lower than those who tested directly in.</p><p>Students noted that the developmental math moved too slowly over the topics they already knew and too quickly over those they didn&rsquo;t know&mdash;and still don&rsquo;t. So Housatonic started self-paced courses, in which students test out of items they know and focus on items they don&rsquo;t, until they ultimately demonstrate all the competencies. Faculty also embed in the course measures of how much time students spend on the work to keep an eye not only on skills but also on <em>affective</em> behavior.</p><p>When Housatonic&nbsp;allowed students to take an online math refresher programs, then retake Accuplacer, 69% of students increased at least one course level.</p><p>Speaking more broadly, Gliniecki and Carriuolo both lamented students&#39; failure to &quot;estimate,&quot; urging that high school calculus courses have students put away their calculators.</p><p><strong>A private option</strong></p><p>Deborah Hirsch, vice president for development at the private, four-year Mount Ida College, said one-third of students there are &ldquo;first-generation,&rdquo; one-third are Pell Grant-eligible; and half of entering Mount Ida students place into developmental education courses, but are also enrolled in college-level courses.</p><p>Mount Ida, she said, has tried to create some linked courses, for example, offering students guided study skills linked with Introductory Psychology.</p><p>And because the sequence of developmental math was a Bermuda Triangle for students, Mount Ida decided to combine the two-level sequence of developmental math courses into one course. The college renovated the classroom with chairs and desks that move easily on wheels, laptops and smartboards. The class features three days of mini-lectures and one day of&nbsp; lab. Mount Ida has also added a &quot;financial literacy&quot; component, so it&rsquo;s more relevant to students who often don&rsquo;t want to be taking high school math again.</p><p>Finally, Mount Ida formed partnership with Persistence Plus&mdash;the &ldquo;Weight Watchers&rdquo; of college completion. The system uses smartphones to give students personalized, real-time &ldquo;nudges&rdquo; to help them set and reach goals, manage their time, cope with setbacks and connect with campus services. The nudges include personalized motivators&mdash;such as &quot;did you know a third of your class is in the library now studying for the exam?&quot;</p><p>Janet Sortor, vice president and dean of academic affairs at Southern Maine Community College, where enrollment has quadrupled in 10 years, promoted an advising course called &ldquo;My Maine Guide.&rdquo; The program offers a personalized online portal for students, which provides quick access to student&rsquo;s electronic portfolio, course schedule, important reminders and other tasks. And students are required to take Freshman Interest Groups&mdash;theme-based one-credit courses that combine college success skills, goal exploration and setting, and investigation of a topic aimed at capturing the interest of students.</p><p><strong>National views</strong></p><p>At an evening session, Bruce Vandal, vice president of Complete College America, and William Trueheart, president of Achieving the Dream, addressed a panel on national views on developmental education and improving graduation odds.</p><p>Vandal noted the urgency of addressing college readiness, particularly in light of the Common Core State Standards assessments coming online in 2014. A study by ACT suggests that in many states, fewer than half of students who take that test will be deemed &ldquo;college ready.&rdquo;</p><p>Vandal urged states to focus on developing strategies that effectively transition students from high school to postsecondary institutions, including early assessment in high school, perhaps 10<sup>th</sup> grade. He also called for better pathways into academic programs by realizing that not all students need the same skills. Students in social sciences and humanities, for example, may not need the heavy algebra appropriate for STEM students. He suggested diversifying the placement tests used to predict success, including adding high school GPA.</p><p>Trueheart described the mission of Achieving the Dream to help students, many of them lower-income and students of color, to be college ready. He held out the example of El Paso Community College in Texas, where 98% of students in 2003-04 needed remedial education, partly because so many students at the border institution did not speak English as their first language. In 10 years, the community college closed achievement gaps in math and English and raised rates of completion significantly.<strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Legislative view</strong></p><p>At a session of legislators and former legislators on the NEBHE board, Maine state Rep. Emily Cain began by citing the recent finding by economist Anthony Carnevale of Georgetown University that job growth is occurring for jobs that require a credential beyond high school, but is declining for jobs that require only a high school diploma.</p><p>Maine state Sen.<em> </em>Brian Langley, Senate chair of the Education Committee, took time from opening his restaurant in Ellsworth, Maine, to describe his path as a nontraditional learner through vocational school, community college, the University of Southern Maine, Syracuse University, and the online Capella University. But, he assured the audience, he understands the pressures of traditional higher education cost issues, having put his kids through Colby College and the University of Michigan. &ldquo;I have a picture in my mind of good culinarians who are still working in the industry but left my programs because they didn&rsquo;t have the math or writing skills to do college-level work.&rdquo; said Langley. &quot;A few have taken remediation courses and failed them; adult ed can be more supportive,&quot; he believes.</p><p>Rhode Island state Sen. Hanna M. Gallo, chair of Education Committee and a speech pathologist by training, said she is a big proponent of full-day kindergarten. If that were available, she said, the college readiness problem wouldn&rsquo;t come down to high school failing or college remediation. We need to remediate <em>not</em> in college, but earlier, she said, adding, that we also need better teacher-training programs at colleges, professional development and accountability for parents and communities.</p><p>Former Massachusetts state Sen. Joan Menard, now vice president at Bristol Community College, said that being all things for all people has become a problem for community colleges. They admit everyone, including adults with 6<sup>th</sup> grade educations, and help employers write workforce training grants, but they are judged on graduation rates. Menard argued that community colleges need to bring legislators to campus not only to ask for more money and when parents and students call with complaints, but to tell them the good things that are happening.</p><p>Among those good things, New Hampshire state Rep. Ralph Boehm, vice chair of the House Education Committee, told of Nashua Community College&#39;s relationships with Honda for car mechanics and Delta Dental&#39;s gift of equipment to New Hampshire Technical Institute to help train dental hygienists.</p><p>Middlesex Community College President Carole Cowan urged community colleges to partner with vocational-technical and high schools. But, she added, don&#39;t dismiss the academic mission&quot; &ldquo;Those technical workers are going to go for a baccalaureate degree some day because they will want to walk that pathway to greater success.&rdquo;</p>','','filtered_html');

The economy requires that. And if we don&rsquo;t develop educational systems that help minorities, help the poor, get access to college, we&rsquo;re not only sacrificing that human talent, but we are really sacrificing our future as nation.&rdquo;<div style=\"overflow: hidden; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); text-align: left; text-decoration: none; border: medium none;\"><p>Though Miami Dade College is one of the largest institutions in the country, individual attention and support for students is a priority, he said.&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;We are creating a culture of success, where failure is not an option,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;</p><p>Padrón is credited with transforming a once commuter two-year college, then named Miami-Dade Community College, into an academic powerhouse with a slew of bachelor&rsquo;s degree programs &ndash; at a fraction of the cost of other universities.</p><p>Initiatives such as mandatory orientation and advising, individualized education plans, and structured curriculum options are keeping students on track and providing them with the kind of personal connections with faculty, staff, and peers that made all the difference to Padrón&rsquo;s success.</p><p>While Padrón was once rejected from universities like Princeton, today some of those same universities have given him honorary Ph.D&rsquo;s. A list of his awards and contributions would take up over five full single-spaced-12-point-font pages - contributions that our world might not have received had Padrón not been given the chance at a higher education.</p><p>&ldquo;Community college changed my life,&rdquo; he says with a melodic Spanish accent, symbolic of all he&rsquo;s achieved, all he&rsquo;s sacrificed, and all he represents when it comes to what can be possible for the next generation of Hispanic leaders.</p><p><b>The Beginning of the American Dream</b></p><p>At that time he arrived at age 15, under Operation Peter Pan, a program that allowed parents to send unaccompanied children overseas to escape communism, Padrón was looking to make it in a country his parents promised would offer greater opportunity.</p><p>Padrón finished high school in Florida, and struggled to learn in a new language. It was the days before bilingual education or ESOL classes.</p><p>&ldquo;It was a whole new brave world,&rdquo; he said of attending high school in America for the first time. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know the language, I didn&rsquo;t know the culture, and I didn&rsquo;t have my parents with me. Trying to understand the system was not easy.&rdquo;</p><p>In addition to trying to manage school, Padrón also worked three to four jobs to support himself and his younger brother.</p><p>&ldquo;I grew up very fast,&rdquo; he says of those years. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d get up a 4 a.m., go to school, and then after that I&rsquo;d iron clothes at a dry cleaner&rsquo;s, then wash cars at a car wash, and then stock inventory at a department store. I spent more hours working than going to school, and slept only two to three hours per night.&rdquo;</p><p>It&rsquo;s difficult that anyone with that kind of schedule and so many obstacles could graduate high school. But Padrón did just that.</p><p>He credits his mother for helping him to not give up.</p><p>&ldquo;If I really wanted a future I&rsquo;d have to go to college,&rdquo; he says of what she instilled.</p><p>&ldquo;But I had no idea how to go to college,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>Padrón looked to his high school counselor for guidance: &ldquo;She told me I was not college material and that I should go to trade school and become a carpenter or plumber.&rdquo;</p><p>Padrón thanked her, but he could not get his mother&rsquo;s voice out of his head. He knew he needed to go to college. So he used all of his savings to apply to the top universities in the country. &ldquo;I was overly ambitious,&rdquo; he says with humor in his voice, &ldquo;I applied to all these top universities thinking I&rsquo;d have a chance.&rdquo;</p><p>That spirit of ambition would pay off later for Padrón.</p><p>In the meantime, the college rejection letters poured in, and eventually equaled the number of applications he had spent his savings to send.</p><p>He would never get to college.</p><p>At least, that would be the story if community colleges didn&rsquo;t exist. &ldquo;I learned that there was this school that had just opened recently,&rdquo; Padrón said of the renewed hope he was given after his rejections, &ldquo;It was called Dade County Junior College at the time.&rdquo;</p><p><b>Community College Was the Difference</b></p><p>For Padrón the community college experience was transformative: &ldquo;It was like I was born again.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There were all these people who took interest in me,&rdquo; Padrón says of why the experience was so life changing. &ldquo;They helped me fill out my application, helped me register, and helped me understand what college was all about.&rdquo;</p><p>Padrón also found that same support with the faculty at the institution: &ldquo;After community college, I went to several other universities and I never found the quality of faculty that I found at Dade County Junior College.&rdquo;</p><p>Padrón also connected with students at the college who had similar backgrounds. &ldquo;We formed a support group,&rdquo; he says of their friendship. He laughed as he described how only one friend had a car, and how every morning eight of them would pile into it and drive to college, and then wait around until the last friend had finished the last class. &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&ldquo;They gave me a sense of belonging, a sense of purpose, and a renewed confidence,&rdquo; Padrón says of the support he received in college.</p><p>That confidence took Padrón all the way to a Ph.D in Economics from the University of Florida, after having graduated Summa Cum Laude from Florida Atlantic University. He then began fielding job offers from the top companies around the country. After living a life of poverty, Padrón jokes, &ldquo;When people asked me what I wanted to do growing up, I simply said &lsquo;I want to be rich.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>After accepting a job offer from DuPont University, Padrón paid a visit to Miami to tell one of his community college professors the great news.</p><p>His professor said, &ldquo;What do you mean you&rsquo;re going to join the corporate monster? We were hoping you&rsquo;d come back here and pay your dues.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He gave me an incredible guilt trip,&rdquo; Padrón says of the encounter. And it worked. &ldquo;I told DuPont that I was going to take a year and teach economics at the college, and would then be back if the offer still stood. I was only going to teach for a year.&rdquo;</p><p>But Padrón never returned to DuPont.</p><p>&ldquo;Halfway through that year of teaching, I knew that&rsquo;s what I wanted to do the rest of my life,&ldquo; Padrón said of this defining decision in his life. &ldquo;Teaching reminded me of my beginnings.

At age 29, he&rsquo;d already spent seven years working in the air-conditioning field. Now, he wanted to a chance to put his engineering class knowledge to work in the real world.</p><p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t need the extra credit,&rdquo; says Alvarez, 29. &ldquo;But I wanted to see what I was capable of.&rdquo;</p><p>Because he&rsquo;d be working with micro-controllers, Alvarez bought some electronics kits online and began experimenting.&nbsp; Next, he recruited his friend and fellow Valencia student, Alex Perez, to help out &mdash; even though Perez wasn&rsquo;t taking Hall&rsquo;s class.</p><p>&ldquo;I wanted to do something hands-on outside the classroom,&rdquo; said Perez. &ldquo;Plus, it seemed really interesting.&rdquo;</p><p>Soon, the two students&nbsp; became engrossed in the work.</p><p>In addition to helping their classmates repair or install lighting in the theater, Alvarez and Perez took on a bigger project, volunteering to install a controller for the fiber-optic lights in the theater. The controller contains a computer chip, which the two Valencia students programmed to control the fans and lighting in the ceiling and the walls of the Star Tower, a facility that memorializes each sick child with a star.</p><p>The two budding engineers worked one or two Saturdays a month for about four months to finish the project. In addition to the fun of doing some hands-on engineering, there were other bonuses: The two also got to work side-by-side with industry professionals, including employees from ITEC Entertainment, an Orlando company that produces theme park rides and designs.</p><p>Now, Perez and Alvarez have moved on to another project at Give Kids the World: They&rsquo;re installing an interactive &ldquo;window&rdquo; inside a room full of trees. Their idea, says Perez, is to make the graphics on the window voice activated.&nbsp; For example, if children are whispering, then the colors in the window will fade in and out. As they raise their voices, the visual effects move faster. And if they&rsquo;re shouting, the window will blink red.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s new hardware and chips involved, so we have to get to know how to program it,&rdquo; Perez said.</p><p>Perez, 24, says the volunteer work reassured him that he&rsquo;s entering the right field. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been interested in computer engineering for a while, but helping design and produce something in the real world was pretty cool,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>Perez, who graduated from Oviedo High School in 2006, didn&rsquo;t start his college career here at Valencia. Instead, the former honors student headed to the University&nbsp; of Central Florida to major in engineering. But he found the large classes overwhelming and struggled.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in a sea of people and it&rsquo;s easy to zone out &mdash; unless you make a special effort,&rdquo; Perez said.</p><p>&ldquo;At UCF, it was hard to get any personal time with your professors,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very impersonal.&rdquo; Yet, until he began taking classes at Valencia, he didn&rsquo;t realize how important one-on-one communication with his professors would be.</p><p>For instance, when he began taking engineering classes at Valencia, Professor Veeramuthu&nbsp;Rajaravivarma asked him what he wanted to do within the field of electronics engineering. When Perez said he was thinking about computer engineering and possibly robotics, Rajaravivarma introduced him to fellow student David Alvarez. Together, the two formed a robotics society at Valencia.</p><p>Unlike Perez, Alvarez took a more convoluted route to Valencia.</p><p>A native of Colombia, he moved to the United States in 2001 at age 18, arriving alone with no family. He lived in Miami for a few months before moving to Orlando. Here, he found a job working in a small convenience store. Determined to improve himself, he landed a job in the air-conditioning field.</p><p>But on weekends, Alvarez flew remote-control model airplanes. And it was there, talking to the other members of his club, that he discovered many of them shared his passions &mdash; and most were engineers.&nbsp; So David, who had become a U.S. citizen, decided to take some engineering classes at Valencia.</p><p>&ldquo;I was getting paid very well in the air-conditioning field,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But I felt that I could do better. I have the traits to do well in school. And now I know the language better.&rdquo;</p><p>Now, David &mdash; who&rsquo;s married and has a little girl &mdash; is&nbsp; preparing to transfer to UCF to finish his bachelor&rsquo;s degree in engineering.</p><p>&ldquo;But right now, I&rsquo;m just getting out there,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting to know people in the field. And by doing a project like this, I&rsquo;m helping people too.&rdquo;</p>','','filtered_html');

Throughout the workshop, we will grapple with the tension between quantity and quality through an exploration of how three Achieving the Dream Institutions&mdash; Kingsborough Community College in New York, Skagit Valley College in Washington, and Valencia College in Florida&mdash; brought their learning communities to scale. We will use More to Most , the MDC guidebook based on lessons learned from the first wave of ATD Institutions to examine how to grow programs beyond the pilot phase. We will also draw from tools developed by the campuses to surface commonalities among the approaches taken by these acknowledged leading institutions in the learning communities field whose student body size and longevity of their learning community programs vary. If you are wondering about the role learning communities can play in turning access into college completion for first-generation, low-income students, this session will deepen your understanding of how learning communities can become an institutional strategy for improving student success.

In this workshop we will discuss the multifaceted approach to developmental education that we have followed in the Accelerated Learning Program (ALP) at CCBC to assist your college in implementing similar faculty development for accelerated models of developmental education. Participants will learn about:</p><ul><li>How teaching in an ALP class differs from traditional teaching.</li><li>Various modes of faculty development: 20-hour institutes, on-line faculty communities, mentoring, half-day workshops, and informal drop-in sessions. Assumptions behind successful faculty development: respecting faculty autonomy, recognizing there can be more than one effective pedagogy, allowing faculty to try out challenging changes, and emphasizing practical applications in the classroom.</li><li>Topics addressed during faculty development events: backward curriculum design, active learning, integrating reading and writing, improving thinking skills, culturally sensitive pedagogy, addressing non-cognitive issues, coordinating the credit and the developmental courses.</li><li>A state-wide faculty development effort in Michigan.</li></ul><p>Presenters</p><ul><li>Peter Adams, Director of Accelerated Learning Program, Community College of Baltimore County, MD</li><li>Susan Gabriel, Associate Professor, English Department, Community College of Baltimore County, MD</li><li>Jenny Schanker, Associate Director, Center for Student Success Michigan Community College Association, MI</li><li>David DeBaker, Assistant Professor, Jackson Community College, MI</li></ul><p><a href=\"#top\">^ top</a></p>','','filtered_html');

And you don&rsquo;t have to go very far on any of the five campuses of Valencia College in central <span class=\"njPopup state\"><a href=\"http://nationaljournal.com/features/restoration-calls/how-a-community-college-s-big-ideas-are-transforming-education-20121004#\">Florida</a></span> to hear what they are. The community-college president&rsquo;s vision has seeped into the bloodstream of the Orlando education community&mdash;deans, faculty, tutors, neighboring colleges, and even employers.</p><p>It may seem odd to hear the same phrases pop up in conversations with various school administrators&mdash;&ldquo;the ecosystem of higher education,&rdquo; for example, or &ldquo;anyone can learn anything under the right conditions&rdquo;&mdash;until you meet Shugart. He has planted and cultivated those seeds in everyone around him.</p><p>&ldquo;What I&rsquo;m after there is not compliance. What I&rsquo;m after there is fertility, fecundity,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;So a guy who&rsquo;s mowing the lawn can say, &lsquo;You know what? It&rsquo;s really not very learning-centered for me to mow right up next to the classrooms when people are trying to learn. I need to mow away from the buildings during prime time.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p><p>If Shugart sounds like a daytime talk-show host, it&rsquo;s no accident. He compares himself to Phil Donahue. &ldquo;I have the same hair.&rdquo; A more apt comparison is to former President Clinton; both leaders have an uncanny ability to make platitudinous statements sound genuine. Both relate easily to people. And, yes, both have great hair.</p><p>&ldquo;From the very first year Sandy was here, he asked two questions: &lsquo;Are students learning? How do we know?&rsquo; &rdquo; said Nasser Hedayat, a former electrical-engineering professor who heads the college&rsquo;s outreach to Orlando employers.</p><p>The answers to Shugart&rsquo;s questions are the reason that Valencia was the first school to win the top prize in the Aspen Institute&rsquo;s College Excellence Program. The contest, which offers $1 million a year for community colleges, was unveiled two years ago by President Obama when he launched a campaign to increase community-college graduations by a total of 5 million by 2020.</p><p>One year later, Aspen awarded Valencia $600,000 and gave four runner-up institutions $100,000 each. Valencia devoted more than half of its award, $350,000, to its unique faculty-training facility; the rest went to student scholarships. School fundraisers say that a matching campaign will at least double the amount of the Aspen award. The recognition that goes with the prize also upped Shugart&rsquo;s national profile. A few minutes before his interview with <em>National Journal,</em> he finished a conference call with White House officials and three university presidents who sat on a panel that took place Monday.</p><p>Shugart thinks of himself as a risk taker. He doesn&rsquo;t like to keep the college&rsquo;s funds in a trust account if he can spend the money on programs that bolster student learning. He is critical of&nbsp; Obama&rsquo;s &ldquo;college completion agenda&rdquo; because he believes it takes emphasis away from what really matters: students&rsquo; learning. Staff members say that having Shugart at the helm encourages them to take risks as well. Everyone calls him Sandy.</p><p>He refuses to follow anyone&rsquo;s script, which makes him both sought after and slightly feared as a public speaker. A few years ago, he removed his name from a list of potential speakers at a hearing of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee after what he described as an &ldquo;awkward conversation&rdquo; with committee staffers; he told them that Pell Grants don&rsquo;t affect students&rsquo; decisions about where to go to college.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on panels, I make people angry. I don&rsquo;t mean to,&rdquo; he said.</p><h2>WHAT IS COLLEGE FOR?</h2><p>Shugart is in the forefront of a national conversation that challenges the traditional, romantic notions of college&mdash;as in brick and ivy, late-night study sessions, fraternity pranks, students hell-bent on changing the world.&nbsp; Shugart is fond of pointing out that only 17 percent of college students fit this sentimental stereotype&mdash;going to school full time, living on campus, completing a four-year degree at one institution.</p><p>Community colleges aren&rsquo;t Yale or Stanford. They cater to the mundane parts of the college experience that don&rsquo;t show up in the movies. Their aim is to quickly and efficiently give students the skills they need to get a job with a decent salary. They train people for stable careers in accounting, electronics, nursing, and information technology. Their administrators use words like &ldquo;competencies.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re really talking about people on the margins and institutions that have long been on the margins of higher education,&rdquo; said Joshua Wyner, who runs the Aspen contest.</p><p>These marginal students are the target of Obama&rsquo;s lofty goal to double college completions by 2020. A-grade students don&rsquo;t need a White House initiative to pull together a college application. C-grade students might. They are the kids who can&rsquo;t get into four-year colleges and probably can&rsquo;t afford them anyway. They might have children and part-time jobs. They usually need some kind of &ldquo;remediation&rdquo; or &ldquo;developmental education&rdquo;&mdash;noncredit classes that teach them what they were supposed to have learned in high school.</p><p>If they make it to college at all, odds are they won&rsquo;t finish. Almost half of the students who enter a community college either fail to get a degree or transfer to a four-year school after six years, according to the American Association of Community Colleges.</p><p>This is a problem, because high school diplomas are no longer going to cut it for Americans who want to make a middle-class salary. New research from the Georgetown Public Policy Institute predicts that, by 2020, two of three jobs will require at least some college education. That figure already hovers around 60 percent.</p><p>But there is good news as well. There are 11 million &ldquo;middle jobs&rdquo; available for people who can&rsquo;t afford or simply can&rsquo;t deal with a full four years of college, according to the report. These are jobs that pay at least $50,000 annually and require some post-high-school education but not a bachelor&rsquo;s degree&mdash;jobs that reduce poverty rates and expand the economy.</p><p>The standard narratives about college must change to accommodate the students who will fill the middle jobs. Finishing has to be the ultimate goal, not finding yourself. Students can&rsquo;t waste time and precious credit hours trying out several majors. &ldquo;When I was in college, the idea was that your freshman and sophomore years was an exploratory time. Totally gone. It is not exploratory,&rdquo; said Joyce Romano, Valencia&rsquo;s vice president for student services. &ldquo;Decide when you&rsquo;re in the womb what you want to do.&rdquo;</p><p>That thinking is controversial. Something precious is lost if colleges focus only on employment outcomes. Last year, the Pew Research Center found that Americans&mdash;even college presidents&mdash;have conflicting views about higher education. Pew surveyed the general public and college presidents separately. In each group, half of the respondents said that the main purpose of college was to give students skills for the workplace. The other half said it should focus on intellectual growth and critical thinking.</p><p>Community colleges are at the heart of this tension. They need to make a clear-cut business case to prospective students who probably don&rsquo;t worry very much about the &ldquo;great books.&rdquo; Valencia&rsquo;s advisers tell high school students that they can double their incomes with a two-year degree. The college has attracted national attention for its better-than-average rate in awarding diplomas to people who otherwise might be running concession stands at one of Orlando&rsquo;s theme parks. Valencia&rsquo;s overall graduation rate is nearly three times the average among large urban public community colleges as defined by the Education Department.</p><p>But it is also important for community colleges to provide an atmosphere in which students are encouraged to think. It helps to have a charismatic leader like Shugart. But even then, figuring out what that secret sauce is, and then bottling it for mass consumption, has proven to be a challenge.</p><h2>BIG IDEAS</h2><p>With Shugart as its talisman, Valencia openly challenges unspoken rules that permeate higher-education circles. Many community colleges depend on their enrollment income to balance their budgets. Valencia sacrifices its enrollment numbers (and the accompanying dollars) by turning students away who fail to register before the first day of a class. Research shows that students who register late are more likely to drop out, so Shugart says it makes sense to head those students off.</p><p>Valencia also doesn&rsquo;t separate student services from academics, which elevates the status of the dean of students but also runs the risk of deflating professorial egos. The school has made its system work by devoting staff resources to each academic program. Faculty members are expected to participate in plotting their students&rsquo; graduation paths, but each program also has an embedded full-time career adviser to track students&rsquo; progress.</p><p>The most important of Valencia&rsquo;s innovations is the hardest to export. It&rsquo;s also hard to explain. Administrators frequently use the word &ldquo;culture&rdquo; when trying to describe it. Here&rsquo;s how it developed.</p><p>Shugart interviewed for the president&rsquo;s job 12 years ago because, he says, he saw the opportunity to invert the prevailing theory of the 1990s&mdash;namely, that &ldquo;students are underprepared and unmotivated and don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s best for them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;We came to a different conclusion,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We said, if we look carefully at our learners, we don&rsquo;t think that there&rsquo;s anything inherently wrong with them.&rdquo;</p><p>That conclusion led to the six &ldquo;big ideas&rdquo; that have both impressed and confounded observers who want to replicate Valencia&rsquo;s successes elsewhere. The big ideas resemble chapter headings from a self-help book:</p><p>1) Anyone can learn anything under the right conditions.</p><p>2) Start right.</p><p>3) Connection and direction.</p><p>4) The college is how the students experience us, not how we experience them.</p><p>5) The purpose of assessment is to improve learning.</p><p>6) Collaboration.</p><p>&ldquo;Every day, we step back and say, &lsquo;What are students experiencing? What do we want them to experience?&rsquo; &rdquo; Shugart said.</p><p>Like most community colleges, Valencia has open enrollment. It doesn&rsquo;t reject people because they failed algebra or even because they lack a permanent address. Shugart has made it clear that student success is everybody&rsquo;s job, so there is a heavy emphasis on teaching and experimenting with new methods.</p><p>Tenure-track faculty members are required to complete a three-year &ldquo;learning academy&rdquo; in which they invent and test theories about how to improve student learning. Adjunct faculty members, who make up about two-thirds of the teachers at Valencia, get a bump in pay if they participate in the same teacher-development courses.</p><p>The college has thousands of class offerings, but it invests most heavily in 15 to 20 &ldquo;gateway courses&rdquo; that make up 40 percent of the curriculum for first-year students. If students pass those courses, they have a far better chance of finishing their degrees. If they don&rsquo;t, they&rsquo;re probably sunk. The college is banking on success in those early classes to cascade into more-advanced classes where students need less hand-holding and teachers need fewer resources.</p><p>All students are expected to map out a graduation plan in their first semester. They must &ldquo;connect&rdquo; with faculty members, career advisers, tutors, and student-services staffers. Tutors&mdash;usually students themselves&mdash;know the professors personally and often sit in on classes to seek out students who might feel shy about asking for help. Tutoring centers are located in central campus areas, and they are packed.</p><p>Valencia constantly parses student-achievement data, but the school does not tie faculty evaluations to those assessments. The analyses don&rsquo;t even identify individual instructors. This is a unique way to use assessments, and it runs counter to education-reform efforts pushed by Obama and others who want student test scores to be factored into teacher evaluations. Faculty evaluations at Valencia are still weighted heavily toward teaching, but they focus on the instructor&rsquo;s actions to engage students rather than test results: How has the instructor measured his own progress? Has she taken student outcomes seriously in her experiments with teaching methods? The teaching academy allows the school to document instructors&rsquo; progress as they develop their own teaching portfolios.</p><p>&ldquo;The accountability is not external. The accountability is internal,&rdquo; said Kurt Ewen, Valencia&rsquo;s assistant vice president of assessments. After a few go-rounds of instructor-blind testing, he said, the reachers actually came to him to find out how their students were doing.</p><p>Shugart is a big fan of consensus, but he says, &ldquo;Committees are bad.&rdquo; He is fond of calling 200 people into structured meetings that smack heavily of group therapy. He splits them into smaller groups. They analyze specific questions and make recommendations. After a set time, they reconvene, refine their questions, and repeat the small-group sessions. At the end, Shugart takes a wireless microphone and walks among the groups, à la Phil Donahue. &ldquo;You seek dissent. &lsquo;Who really disagrees with this? Tell me why.&rsquo; &hellip; It&rsquo;s a technique designed to reach a strong set of ideas in consensus that are actionable in two and a half hours instead of two and a half years of committees,&rdquo; he said.</p><p>Given these unusual methods, Valencia administrators have a tough time explaining to outsiders how they work. The Aspen prize committee puzzled over the magic ingredients of the school&rsquo;s success. &ldquo;They would say, &lsquo;So we see these numbers where you have these many students graduating now or this kind of success. What do you attribute that to?&rsquo; &rdquo; Ewen said. &ldquo;Behind the question was, &lsquo;What specific strategies can another school employ that would get the same results as you?&rsquo; And the answer is, there are none.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Fifty people met with [the committee], and, to a person, they would come out of the meeting saying, &lsquo;They keep asking me: That&rsquo;s all good, but exactly what is making the difference here?&rsquo; &rdquo; recalls Romano, the student services vice president. &ldquo;They left, and we thought, &lsquo;OK, well, there&rsquo;s no way we&rsquo;re going to win, because they obviously are looking for something more tangible.&rsquo; &rdquo;</p><p>The Aspen judges were tough on Valencia in part because the big ideas that guide the school can easily be dismissed as New Age mumbo jumbo. Anyone can say that enrollment numbers are less important than learning, but Shugart showed he meant it when he stopped distributing enrollment reports to the faculty. &ldquo;That was transformational,&rdquo; Aspen&rsquo;s Wyner said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re saying as a new president, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m having you do things that will literally sink the ship. I&rsquo;m willing to bet my presidency on this.&rsquo; Don&rsquo;t add classes on the first day. Take away enrollment reports. And students are still here.&rdquo;</p><h2>COLLABORATE, DON&rsquo;T COMPETE</h2><p>Collaboration in the community is where Valencia turns free-enterprise notions of competition on their head. The colleges in the Orlando area openly avoid competing with one another for students. Three colleges collectively agreed that Valencia should be the one to offer a degree requested by defense contractor Northrop Grumman. Because Valencia already had the most advanced electrical-engineering curriculum, the other two agreed to opt out.</p><p>Valencia, in turn, offers only a few bachelor&rsquo;s degrees&mdash;ones not offered by the University of Central Florida, the behemoth four-year university that is a distant goal for many of the state&rsquo;s high-school students. Why duplicate when you can supplement, Shugart reasoned.</p><p>Valencia&rsquo;s most potent weapon to attract students is the chance for a direct path to UCF. The university guarantees that those with an associate&rsquo;s degree from Valencia or three other community colleges can come in as juniors. The program, dubbed Direct Connect, appeals to students who may have difficulty getting into or paying for UCF. State budget cuts forced UCF to increase tuition by 15 percent this year, and its admissions policies have also gotten more selective over time. The average SAT scores for incoming freshmen have jumped 77 points in 10 years.</p><p>Direct Connect is the game changer that has altered the value of the two-year college in the minds of students and parents. &ldquo;All parents want their child to have a bachelor&rsquo;s degree, a four-year degree.&hellip; Well, in a sense, the career path with the [associate&rsquo;s] degree can give them that,&rdquo; said Joan Tiller, who runs special projects for Valencia.</p><p>Shugart and UCF President John Hitt collaborated on Direct Connect. In 2005, the two presidents recruited the three other community colleges to hash out course work and other details that would give students a smooth transition to the four-year university.</p><p>The negotiations required a high level of trust from UCF. It took on an obligation to smaller colleges that don&rsquo;t turn people away and offer a lot of remedial courses. The community colleges took on the job of making sure their graduates showed up at the university prepared to be juniors.</p><p>&ldquo;We all have drunk the same water and believe that we can do more together than we can do competing against one another. It sounds like mom and apple pie, but it really is true,&rdquo; said UCF Provost Tony Waldrop.</p><p>The university has advisory offices on all the community-college campuses served by Direct Connect, and all the staff advisers are in constant contact. Students in Valencia&rsquo;s elite honors program are automatically enrolled in UCF&rsquo;s honors program, and the university periodically offers free football tickets to community-college students.</p><p>It can be difficult for some students (or their parents) to accept that they will spend their first college years on a campus that offers more technical certificates than student-life activities. Romano said that it drives her crazy when students transfer to UCF before finishing all of their prerequisites. The university&rsquo;s courses are more expensive, and students who leave prematurely risk running out of financial aid.</p><p>Still, Romano understands the yearning to move beyond an uber-practical community college for a big-time university. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big campus. They have a Greek life,&rdquo; she said.</p><p>&ldquo;They have a bar in the student center,&rdquo; added Valencia&rsquo;s academic dean, Nick Bekas.</p><p>Valencia is not alone in telling high-school students that there are easier and cheaper ways to get to the four-year university than through a grueling senior-year application process. A recent report from the National Student Clearinghouse found that 45 percent of all students who completed a degree at a four-year institution in 2010-11 had previously enrolled at a two-year institution.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s important for students to understand that there are multiple paths to success. They don&rsquo;t have to cinch that same degree in three years,&rdquo; said Doug Shapiro, the clearinghouse&rsquo;s executive director of research.</p><h2>DEGREES FOR EMPLOYERS</h2><p>Valencia offers a hands-on, job-training college experience that flouts the traditional classroom picture. Students in the school&rsquo;s culinary lab wear chef&rsquo;s uniforms and trace frosting designs on cookie sheets. Officials are proud that their culinary-arts degree is<br />a fraction of the cost of the same degree at a private academy.</p><p>Students in an invasive-cardiology class are decked out in full hospital gear. They practice threading guide wires through tiny catheter tubes and injecting dye. The object is to get the dye into the tube without air bubbles, which requires a steady hand. &ldquo;When a bubble gets injected, you can stroke the patient,&rdquo; said student Nalini Ghisiawan. The program had a 100 percent job-placement rate last year.</p><p>The business community in Central Florida is so closely interwoven with the area colleges that it is sometimes difficult to distinguish the two. In August, Valencia opened a satellite campus in Lake Nona Medical City, a planned cluster of hospitals and medical-research institutions. Once a cow pasture, the hub also houses a campus for the University of Central Florida&rsquo;s medical school, a Veterans Administration facility, and a cutting-edge children&rsquo;s hospital.</p><p>Valencia was involved in the Lake Nona planning from the beginning. The goal was to create a friendly environment for science-related companies and to build on Orlando&rsquo;s lucrative tourism industry. City officials hope that the area will become a mecca for medical conferences. An international airport is nearby. The presence of SeaWorld, Universal Studios, and Disney World ensures plenty of hotel space.</p><p>Valencia tries to craft its degrees to what employers need. The college doubled its nursing program to respond to a shortage at Florida Hospital, which ponied up $1 million for the expansion. The hospital donated equipment, and the school made sure that the students were trained on it.</p><p>Shugart recalled the conversation that hatched the deal. Around a boardroom table of hospital and college executives, Florida Hospital President Lars Houmann said he expected to spend $24 million a year to recruit and hire 1,000 nurses, ad infinitum.</p><p>&ldquo;I said, &lsquo;Well, from what you&rsquo;re telling me, I need to produce another 300 nurses a year to save you $12 million. Is that worth a million to you?&rsquo; It&rsquo;s a business proposition,&rdquo; Shugart said.</p><p>Cozy relationships between educators and employers can backfire if the market suddenly changes, of course. That&rsquo;s what happened with Northrop Grumman, which asked Valencia in 2006 to develop a laser-photonics program that would cater to its needs. At the time, the defense contractor was scrambling for workers to build the laser-guided missile components and scanning equipment that the military was screaming for.</p><p>Massive defense-spending cuts suddenly dried up that demand last year. Northrop Grumman laid off 200 employees, some of them graduates of Valencia&rsquo;s program. The layoffs caused enough of a disturbance that the White House shied away from including Valencia&rsquo;s laser-photonics program in one of President Obama&rsquo;s speeches promoting college/employer relationships.</p><p>More broadly, critics say that aligning academic programs so closely with employers&rsquo; needs does a disservice to students who need a broader education. They may be thinking of people like Vik Cesalien, who interned at Northrop Grumman as part of a high school program dedicated to laser photonics. Cesalien is going for his bachelor&rsquo;s degree in lasers and electronics, and he wants to work at Northrop Grumman. The only trouble is, the giant contractor isn&rsquo;t hiring.</p><p>A narrow focus on one company misses the point. A host of other Orlando employers were involved in crafting Valencia&rsquo;s laser-photonics program, but they didn&rsquo;t get as much publicity because they didn&rsquo;t write the biggest checks and they didn&rsquo;t have as dire a need for workers. But the program is still going strong with contributions from a variety of employers, including Northrop Grumman.</p><p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re great. They&rsquo;re still on the advisory committee. They still started it. When their contracts come back, they&rsquo;ll hire people,&rdquo; Shugart said. &ldquo;If the people we trained got laid off, that&rsquo;s still OK with me, because skills are a durable, transferable, fungible asset.&rdquo;</p><p>A certificate in laser photonics may not get someone a job at Northrop Grumman, but it can allow him to design theme parks instead of just operating the rides. That&rsquo;s what happened to Jimmy Hurst, a technician at Universal Studios who spent the last year putting together graphic displays for the new Harry Potter theme park. He was already working at Universal when he decided to get an associate&rsquo;s degree from Valencia. Without it, he would have been stuck in a dead-end job. He tells his younger colleagues that a professional degree is their ticket to advancement. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll hire you as a technician, but that&rsquo;s as far as you&rsquo;re going to go&rdquo; without it, he said.</p><p>This is the story that Valencia is trying to tell in a hundred different ways: College is for everyone. College doesn&rsquo;t have to be four years of book learning. Transfers are OK. Part-time school is fine. Two-year degrees aren&rsquo;t terminal. Employers want degree holders who are from the area, and Valencia can offer them.</p><p>Shugart is lucky that he operates in an environment friendly to his off-the-wall ideas. (He once considered inserting $5 bills into required textbooks to encourage students to buy early.) Not every college has resources to freeze tuition, as Valencia did this year. Not every college has employees who would accept the accompanying wage freeze without complaint. Not every college is nestled in the heart of a booming health care and tourism region that is willing to support it.</p><p>Not every college can do what Valencia does. That&rsquo;s kind of the point. And if middle-class employment is going to continue into the next generation, there should be more places like it.</p>','','filtered_html');

They deserve recognition for their dedication to the student success movement.&rdquo;</p><p>Leader Colleges are demonstrating the power of the Achieving the Dream Student-Centered Model of Institutional Improvement by raising persistence and graduation rates and closing achievement gaps. Each college approaches the work differently, but with the guidance of the model and Achieving the Dream Coaches, colleges implement data-informed programs and policies that build long-term, institution-wide commitment to student success. Examples include: college readiness programs, mandatory new student orientation, student success courses, developmental course redesign, curriculum redesign, and intensive and individualized advising.</p><p>&quot;Elgin Community College is honored to be recognized as an Achieving the Dream Leader College,&quot; said Elgin Community College President David Sam. &quot;Our faculty and staff have been working diligently to make data-informed decisions to help close achievement gaps and remove barriers for our students. This distinction affirms the outstanding leadership of our faculty members, administrators, staff, and Board of Trustees as they support our students in their daily efforts to achieve their dreams.&quot;</p><p>The following examples highlight the results these 14 colleges are seeing as they raise the bar to better serve their students:</p><ul><li>Bay de Noc Community College increased success rates in gateway English courses from 69.1% in 2005 to 74.2% in 2012. This improvement is associated with the expansion of the First-Year Experience course, a redesign of the college&#39;s orientation and advising system, improvements to the Transitional Developmental English Courses and Transitional Reading Courses, and professional development to the majority of their faculty and staff. The First-Year Experience course has been scaled from serving 20.4% of developmental education students in Fall 2009 to serving 42.0% of developmental education students in Fall 2011.<br />&nbsp;</li><li>Central Piedmont Community College increased student course completion rates for all students from 65% in Fall 2007 to 72% in the Fall 2011, and term-to-term retention for IPEDS students from 69% in Fall 2006 to 83% in Fall 2011. These increases in student success are associated with a new pre-placement test prep program, a redesigned new student orientation, the development of an online student orientation, the implementation of case management advising system, a change in the early withdrawal policy, and a minority male mentoring program.<br />&nbsp;</li><li>Community College of Baltimore County increased success rates in developmental and gateway English courses substantially through the development and implementation of an accelerated English developmental sequence. Students in the accelerated English program have increased their gateway successful completion rates from a baseline of 30% to 74% in Fall 2010. Community College of Baltimore County has become a national leader in accelerated developmental education and is currently working with community colleges across the country to replicate this acceleration strategy.<br />&nbsp;</li><li>College of the Ouachitas increased graduation and transfer rates for all students from 43.2% in 2008-09 to 51.5% in 2011-12. This increase is associated with a multi-faceted approach to address the First-Year Experience of all students, which includes mandatory new student orientation and registration, enrollment in a credit-bearing freshman seminar, developmental math redesign, curricular redesign, and design and implementation of a social networking/support program called Men on a Mission that targets student success and retention of African American males.<br />&nbsp;</li><li>Davidson County Community College increased the percentage of students successfully completing developmental education courses. The college did this through student coaching, requiring a student success course, increasing the number of full-time faculty devoted to teaching developmental education, and changing their course withdrawal policy. This resulted in an increase in students completing all developmental math courses within one year from 20.4% in 2007-08 to 28% in 2010-11; an increase in students successfully completing all developmental English courses from 27.8% in 2007-08 to 38.7% in 2010-11; and an increase in the percentage of students completing developmental reading within one year from 25.7% to 43%.<br />&nbsp;</li><li>Elgin Community College increased overall fall to spring retention from 67% in 2006 to 78% in 2010. Disaggregated data for Black and Hispanic students also increased: from 51% to 67% for Black students, from 67% to 80% for Hispanic students, and 72% to 78% for developmental education students from 2006 to 2010. Successful course completion also increased overall from 67% of course enrollments in 2006 to 72% in 2012. The number of completers (degrees and certificates total) has increase by 11% (from 9% to 20%) from 2006 - 2008. These remarkable gains are associated with the establishment of a formal partnership between Elgin Community College and four public school districts in their service areas, the redesign of the First-Year Experience supports for all incoming degree- or certificate-seeking students, and a series of changes to developmental education.<br />&nbsp;</li><li>Greenville Technical College increased student fall to spring persistence for all students from 62.5% in 2007-08 to 72.7% in 2011-12. This persistence was particularly impressive for African American students with the increase going from 57.5% in 2007-08 to 71.3% in 2011-12. This improvement is associated with the college&rsquo;s New Student Orientation that has been scaled to reach 95% of new Greenville Technical College students.<br />&nbsp;</li><li>Lone Star College System increased persistence rates for all students from 2006 to 2011. In addition, the college is closing and narrowing achievement gaps between student subgroups.. In 2006, the persistence rate of White students exceeded the persistence rate of Black student by three percentage points (67% and 64%). Today, 69% of White students persist and 72% of Black students persist from fall-to-spring. The persistence gap between Hispanic students and Black students has narrowed from five percentage points to one percentage points (fall-to-spring) between 2006 and 2010 (from 64% to 72% persistence for Black students and 69% to 73% persistence for Hispanic students).<br />&nbsp;</li><li>National Park Community College increased fall to spring retention of Pell Grant recipients in their student success course from 60.5% (average 2004-2007) to 73.8% in 2010- 2011. This improvement is associated with their first year success course called College Seminar that is required for all full-time, degree-seeking students. The success of the College Seminar course stems from a redesign of the course to utilize cooperative learning strategies, the On Course curriculum, and a module on fiscal responsibility. The course has also been scaled up to reach 85% of the college&rsquo;s students.<br />&nbsp;</li><li>Springfield Technical Community College increased fall to spring retention rates for the Achieving the Dream cohort students from 69% in 2008-2009 to 77% in 2011-2012. Retention rates also climbed for white students (76% to 80%), Hispanic students (62% to 73%), and African-American students (65% to 74%). This improvement is associated with the college&rsquo;s Intrusive Advising model.<br />&nbsp;</li><li>Temple College increased the course completion rates of developmental students from 53.8% in 2007-08 to 56.1% in 2011-2012. These success rates increased significantly for populations that were at high risk of dropping out, including males of color (African American students: 38%-44% and Hispanic students: 54%-59%) and students who receive Pell grants (50%-55%). This increase is associated with the creation of a centralized student success division, professional development, continuous orientation, and the implementation of Zero Week between the end of registration and the first day of classes (when the college holds student success workshops for students and planning time for faculty and staff).<br />&nbsp;</li><li>Texarkana College increased successful completion of developmental courses for first-time-in-college students from 43% in 2006 to 54% in 2011. This improvement is associated with the college&rsquo;s student success course, reorganizing developmental education at the college, required weekly attendance in tutorial lab sessions for all developmental education students, and providing access to individualized tutorial assistance through multiple formats.<br />&nbsp;</li><li>Trident Technical College increased developmental and gateway math course completion from 40.3% in 2006 to 44.9% in 2011. Successful completion of developmental courses has increased from 35.4% in 2006 to 40.3% in 2011. Successful completion of gateway courses has increased from 46.9% in 2006 to 54.8% in 2011. These improvements are associated with several strategies to address the variety of math students&rsquo; needs including: changes in placement criteria, altering instructional methods, and providing more support both in and outside the classroom. These interventions have been scaled to reach 75% of the developmental and gateway math students.<br />&nbsp;</li><li>University of Hawai&rsquo;i Community Colleges increased the successful completion of first-time developmental math students in their first year from 53.8% in 2007 to 59.8% in 2010. The colleges increased the same rate for Native Hawaiian students from 48.4% in 2007 to 58.9% in 2010, effectively closing the achievement gap between Native Hawaiian students and their peers in this measurement. This increase is associated with redesigned developmental math.</li></ul><p>&quot;This prestigious designation as a leader college certainly affirms our commitment to helping students achieve success,&rdquo; said John Morton, Vice President for Community Colleges, University of Hawai&#39;i, &ldquo;and recognizes the perseverance of our faculty and staff in making data-informed decisions in closing achievement gaps and removing barriers for our students, particularly Native Hawaiian students and low-income students.&quot;</p><p><strong>Leader College Criteria</strong><br />In order to be eligible for Leader College distinction, colleges must demonstrate commitment to and progress on the principles and values of Achieving the Dream: committed leadership, use of evidence to improve programs and services, broad engagement, and systemic institutional improvement all guided by a student-centered vision focused on equity and excellence. To meet the Achieving the Dream Leader College criteria for performance, colleges must present evidence of improvement in student achievement on one of the measures below over three or more years:</p><ul><li>Successfully complete remedial or developmental instruction and advance to credit-bearing courses</li><li>Enroll in and successfully complete the initial college-level or gateway courses in subjects such as math and English</li><li>Complete the courses they take with a grade of &quot;C&quot; or better</li><li>Persistence from one term to the next</li><li>Earn a certificate or associate degree</li></ul><p>Additionally, each Leader College has successfully implemented at least one student success intervention that is advancing student outcomes. The intervention is of sufficient scale to benefit a substantial proportion of the total target student population. Indeed, these institutions have met high standards of practice and performance and Achieving the Dream expects these colleges to support other colleges within the Achieving the Dream community of learners.

Today and tomorrow, the selected colleges will convene in Silver Spring for the Catalyst Fund Kickoff.</p><p>The Catalyst Fund grants, administered by Achieving the Dream with funding from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, will assist these colleges in the process of scaling effective interventions to reach a significantly large population of students. These four Leader Colleges were selected because of their known commitment to student-centered, evidence-based reforms and outstanding increases in student outcomes.</p><p>&ldquo;Postsecondary completion is one of the Gates Foundation&rsquo;s major priorities,&rdquo; said Suzanne Walsh, Senior Program Officer, Postsecondary Success at the Gates Foundation. &ldquo;We want to see most students who enroll in a community college complete what they started. Achieving the Dream Colleges have a great tradition of working with students in an intense way and effectively using evidence to guide their decision-making process. We are pleased to fund this critical initiative to scale proven interventions.&rdquo;</p><p>The following four Achieving the Dream Leader Colleges will each receive a $215,000 grant to spur the expansion of proven interventions at the heart of their student success work.</p><ul><li>Brazosport College (Lake Jackson, TX)</li><li>Bunker Hill Community College (Boston, MA)</li><li>Durham Technical Community College (Durham, NC)</li><li>Patrick Henry Community College (Martinsville, VA)</li></ul><p>&quot;The four Achieving the Dream Leader Colleges that are recipients of this grant are recognized as leaders in the Achieving the Dream National Reform Network for their proven success and commitment to student achievement,&rdquo; said Rachel Singer, Vice President for Community College Relations and Applied Research, Achieving the Dream, Inc. &ldquo;The effective practices they have chosen to scale will yield important information and lessons which will be used to inform the field.&rdquo;</p><p>The Achieving the Dream National Reform Network is committed to investigating ways to scale effective interventions to ensure that more, and ultimately most, students attain the skills and credentials necessary for success in the global economy. Beginning with these four Leader Colleges, the Catalyst Fund will support the expansion of programs and policies that promote widespread scaling &ndash; both within the colleges and to other community colleges across the nation.</p><p>&ldquo;Bunker Hill Community College is honored to be one of the four colleges nationally to be awarded an Achieving the Dream Catalyst Fund grant,&rdquo; said Bunker Hill Community College President Mary Fifield. &ldquo;Our college&rsquo;s successful Learning Communities initiative, developed in partnership with Achieving the Dream, has already served more than 4,000 students and has a year-to-year retention record 32 percent higher than our general student population. The Catalyst Fund grant will enable us to reach and benefit more diverse and more part-time students on an even larger scale. Additionally, it brings us closer to total college-wide institutionalization of Learning Communities.&rdquo;</p><p>As part of the Catalyst Fund, each college will work to scale their proven interventions through the Achieving the Dream Student-Centered Model of Institutional Improvement, which is based upon four critical principles: committed leadership, use of evidence to improve programs and services, broad engagement, and systematic institutional improvement. Additionally, these colleges will work to scale their interventions in a systematic way, so that the interventions may be embedded in the institutions&rsquo; framework for sustainability.</p><p>Lessons learned from these colleges will help inform best practices for scaling interventions to better inform the Achieving the Dream National Reform Network and community colleges across the nation.</p><p>Presidents, faculty, and staff from the four selected colleges and Achieving the Dream, will convene for an inaugural Catalyst Fund Kickoff Institute at the Sheraton in Silver Spring, MD on November 15, 2012 at 8 AM to November 16, 2012 at 12 PM.</p><p><strong>Achieving the Dream Leader Colleges</strong><br />Leader Colleges are demonstrating the power of the Achieving the Dream Student-Centered Model of Institutional Improvement. They show that it is possible to raise persistence and graduation rates, close achievement gaps, and improve lives. Leader Colleges represent the ultimate goal of Achieving the Dream, and as such, support other institutions within a community of learners. To be eligible for Leader College distinction, colleges must demonstrate commitment to and progress on the Achieving the Dream principles: committed leadership, use of evidence to improve programs and services, broad engagement, and systemic institutional improvement. They must also show three years of sustained improvement of student success on at least one of the following measures of performance: Completion of certificates or degrees Term-to-term and year-to-year retention Completion of college-level math and English courses Advancement from developmental to credit-bearing courses Course completion For more information on the Leader Colleges, <a href=\"/get_involved/leader_colleges\">click here</a>.</p><p><strong>Achieving the Dream, Inc.</strong><br />Achieving the Dream, Inc. is a national nonprofit that is dedicated to helping more community college students, particularly low-income students and students of color, stay in school and earn a college certificate or degree. Evidence-based, student-centered, and built on the values of equity and excellence, Achieving the Dream is closing achievement gaps and accelerating student success nationwide by: 1) guiding evidence-based institutional improvement, 2) leading policy change, 3) generating knowledge, and 4) engaging the public.

The first of those meetings will take place November 27 in Boston, MA. Representatives from the states, Achieving the Dream, and Jobs for the Future will be in attendance. Attendees will discuss their work; specifically, how they will improve student services so more students can succeed in college.</p><p>In the coming year, Achieving the Dream supported states will pursue a range of evidence-based reform initiatives, from piloting performance-based scholarships and improving transfer success, to fundamentally transforming the delivery of developmental education. These reforms are crucial in meeting the national demand for a more college-educated citizenry.</p><p>&ldquo;The states that are joining together in this effort are leaders in innovation to improve student success and completion,&rdquo; said Richard Kazis, Senior Vice President, Jobs for the Future. &ldquo;The Postsecondary State Policy Network provides them with a high-impact vehicle for efficient sharing of proven strategies for implementing policies that make a difference.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Critical Juncture</strong><br />Community colleges and states today face a tremendous challenge: educate more students than ever &ndash; a significant number of whom are underprepared &ndash; in an era of decreased budgets. All the while, the nation demands increases in student performance outcomes. For many states, this new normal is creating a ripe environment for innovation and sweeping reform. Connecticut, Hawai&rsquo;i, Massachusetts, Oklahoma, and Virginia are committed to exploring, supporting, and helping scale promising statewide reforms that can create meaningful academic and career pathways for all students.</p><p>&ldquo;While a significant number of the students walking through the community college front door may not be college-ready, Achieving the Dream and our National Reform Network believe that all students walking through the door are college-material,&rdquo; said Carol Lincoln, Senior Vice President, Achieving the Dream. &ldquo;We will work closely with our policy states to ensure that the reforms are guided by our values of equity, excellence, and evidence.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>The History and Role of State Policy at Achieving the Dream</strong><br />Since 2004, state policy reform has been an integral part of the bold goal set forth by Achieving the Dream &ndash; to dramatically increase success for all community college students. These efforts have been and continue to be led by Jobs for the Future. Community colleges cannot and should not do this work alone. &nbsp;States are leveraging policy as a powerful force to help the efforts of community colleges working to close achievement gaps and increase student success and completion.</p><p>Some of the most promising advances in student success are in states where community college leaders and state policy-makers are working together as partners as they take well-informed, mutually-reinforcing reform decisions anchored in equity and excellence.</p><p>The Virginia Community College System is a prime example of this partnership at work.</p><p>In collaboration with its college stakeholders it has embarked on a large-scale and transformative redesign of developmental education. The system has implemented a sequence of math modules, an integrated reading and writing curriculum, and a new assessment and placement protocol across all 23 of its community colleges.</p><p>In its current strategic plan, Achieve 2015, the state system aims at a 50 percent increase in the number of community college students who earn a degree, transfer to a four-year institution, or earn a workforce credential.&nbsp; For students from groups traditionally underrepresented in higher education, the target is a 75 percent increase.</p><p><strong>Postsecondary State Policy Network</strong><br />The Postsecondary State Policy Network, led by Jobs for the Future in conjunction with the Achieving the Dream National Reform Network, is a multi-state collaboration committed to advancing state policy agendas that accelerate community college student success and completion. The network evolved out of the state policy efforts for the Achieving the Dream National Reform Network, including the Developmental Education Initiative. The network includes 11 states that are continuing their work with support from Achieving the Dream and the Completion by Design and Student Success Center initiatives. JFF helps teams from the 11 network states maximize peer learning and develop and implement policies that promote community college student success.

During this time period, student persistence rate for Black students at LSCS increased from 64 percent to 72 percent, and for Hispanic students, it went from 69 percent to 73 percent. Persistence rate for White students at LSCS also increased, from 67 percent to 69 percent.</p><p>Leader Colleges are demonstrating the power of the Achieving the Dream Student-Centered Model of Institutional Improvement by raising persistence and graduation rates and closing achievement gaps.</p><p>Each college approaches the work differently, but with the guidance of the model and AtD coaches, colleges implement data-informed programs and policies that build long-term, institution-wide commitment to student success. Examples include: college readiness programs, mandatory new student orientation, student success courses, developmental course redesign, curriculum redesign, and intensive and individualized advising.</p><p>&ldquo;We are proud of Lone Star College System for earning this respected distinction,&rdquo; said Rachel Singer, AtD vice president for community college relations and applied research. &ldquo;Lone Star College has raised the bar on promising practices that will impact policies to help more students succeed. The college deserves recognition for its dedication to the student success movement.&rdquo;</p><p>In order to be eligible for Leader College distinction, colleges must demonstrate commitment to and progress on the principles and values of AtD: committed leadership, use of evidence to improve programs and services, broad engagement, and systemic institutional improvement all guided by a student-centered vision focused on equity and excellence. Additionally, each Leader College has successfully implemented at least one student success intervention that is advancing student outcomes.</p><p>In addition to LSCS, the new Leader Colleges are: Bay de Noc College, Escanaba, Mich.; Central Piedmont Community College, Charlotte, N.C.; Community College of Baltimore County, Baltimore; College of the Ouachitas, Malvern, Ark.; Davidson County Community College, Thomasville, N.C.; Elgin Community College, Elgin, Ill.; Greenville Technical College, Greenville, S.C.; National Park Community College, Hot Springs, Ark.; Springfield Technical Community College, Springfield, Mass.; Temple College, Temple, Texas; Texarkana College, Texarkana, Texas; Trident Technical College, North Charleston, S.C.; and University of Hawai&rsquo;i Community Colleges, Honolulu.</p><p>These colleges have identified workable solutions to issues such as enhancing the experience of first-year students, improving developmental education, closing achievement gaps, strengthening academic and personal advising for students in need of additional support, strengthening links to high schools and four-year institutions to strengthen student preparation and advancement, and increasing retention, persistence rates, and the number of certificate and degree recipients.

PHCC was selected because of its known commitment to student-centered, evidence-based reforms and outstanding increases in student outcomes.</p><p>&ldquo;Patrick Henry Community College is recognized as a leader in the Achieving the Dream National Reform Network for its proven success and commitment to student achievement,&rdquo; said Rachel Singer, Vice President for Community College Relations and Applied Research, Achieving the Dream, Inc. &ldquo;The effective practices Patrick Henry has chosen to scale will yield important information and lessons which will be used to inform the field.&rdquo;</p><p>PHCC is known as a Leader College based on successes in student persistence and graduation rates through the use of cooperative learning. The college became an Achieving the Dream (AtD) college in 2004 as one of 26 community colleges in the nation to pilot the program, funded by the Lumina Foundation. Demonstrated success with AtD facilitated PHCC to become one of 15 community colleges in the country to receive a Developmental Education Initiative grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2009. That grant allowed PHCC to continue and broaden the scope of its cooperative education program, which in turn paved the way for this latest grant from the Gates Foundation.</p><p>Armed with a Catalyst grant, PHCC has an opportunity to make an even greater impact on student success and will focus attention on the ever-growing number of students enrolled in online classes. The college will use the funds to implement cooperative learning strategies in the online environment, as well as training faculty at other community colleges across the country. To date, PHCC has trained faculty at more than 40 community colleges nationwide.</p><p>&ldquo;This generous grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation will help Patrick Henry Community College leverage its already successful cooperative learning program to serve even more PHCC students,&rdquo; Godwin said. &ldquo;We now engage and see success with more than half of our students through cooperative learning. This grant will allow us to increase that to three quarters.&rdquo;</p><p>The Achieving the Dream National Reform Network is committed to investigating ways to scale effective interventions to ensure that more, and ultimately most, students attain the skills and credentials necessary for success in the global economy. Beginning with PHCC, the Catalyst Fund will support the expansion of programs and policies that support widespread scaling &ndash; both within the colleges and to other community colleges across the nation.</p><p>&ldquo;Postsecondary completion is one of the Gates Foundation&rsquo;s major priorities,&rdquo; said Suzanne Walsh, Senior Program Officer, Postsecondary Success at the Gates Foundation. &ldquo;We want to see most students who enroll in a community college complete what they started. Achieving the Dream Colleges have a great tradition of working with students in an intense way and effectively using evidence to guide their decision-making process. We are pleased to fund this critical initiative to scale proven interventions.&rdquo;</p><p>As part of the Catalyst Fund, PHCC will work to scale its proven interventions through the Achieving the Dream Student Centered Model of Institutional Improvement, which is based upon four critical principles: committed leadership, use of evidence to improve programs and services, broad engagement, and systematic institutional improvement. Additionally, the college will work to scale its interventions in a systematic way, so that the interventions may be embedded in the institutions&rsquo; framework for sustainability.</p><p>Lessons learned from Patrick Henry will help inform best practices for scaling interventions to better inform the Achieving the Dream National Reform Network and community colleges across the nation.</p><p>Godwin and several faculty and staff at PHCC have convened with Achieving the Dream and the other three colleges for an inaugural Catalyst Fund Kickoff Institute at the Sheraton in Silver Spring, MD on November 15 &ndash; November 16.</p><p>The following are all four Achieving the Dream Leader Colleges that will each receive a $215,000 grant to spur the expansion of proven interventions at the heart of their student success work.</p><ul><li>Brazosport College (Lake Jackson, TX)</li><li>Bunker Hill Community College (Boston, MA)</li><li>Durham Technical Community College (Durham, NC)</li><li>Patrick Henry Community College (Martinsville, VA)</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Achieving the Dream Leader Colleges</p><p>Leader Colleges are demonstrating the power of the Achieving the Dream Student-Centered Model of Institutional Improvement.
