college student outcomes involve relatively small innovations or changes at the margins achieving the dream is based on the premise that to improve student success on a substantial scale colleges need to fundamentally change the way they operate achieving the dream colleges commit to our studentcentered model of institutional improvement based on four principles the model frames the overall workof helping more students particularly lowincome students and students of color stay in school and earn a college certificate or degree each college approaches the work differently but achieving the dream s fivestep process provides practical guidelines for keeping the focus where it belongs and building momentum over time throughout the process achieving the dream coaches offer customized support and help each college s core team implement datainformed programs and policies that build longterm institutionwide commitment to student success  four principles  principle 1 committed leadership senior college leaders actively support efforts to improve student success not just to increase enrollments and are committed to achieving equity in student outcomes across racial ethnic and income groups administrators board members and faculty and staff leaders demonstrate a willingness to make changes in policies programs and resource allocation to improve student success principle 2 use of evidence to improve programs and services the college establishes processes for using data about student progression and outcomes to identify achievement gaps among student groups formulates strategies for addressing the gaps identified and improving student success overall and evaluates the effectiveness of those strategies principle 3 broad engagement faculty student services staff and administrators share responsibility for student success and collaborate on assessing the effectiveness of programs and services and improving them other stakeholders with influence on student success k12 systems community groups employers etc are included in discussions about student performance desired outcomes and potential improvement strategies the college also gains invaluable insight about ways to improve student success from students themselves through surveys focus groups and or advisory councils principle 4 systemic institutional improvement the college establishes planning processes that rely on data to set goals for student success and then uses the data to measure goal attainment the college regularly evaluates its academic programs and services to determine how well they promote student success and how they can be improved decisions about budget allocations are based on evidence of program effectiveness and are linked to plans to increase student success faculty and staff are afforded professional development opportunities that reinforce efforts that help to close achievement gaps and improve overall student success five steps  achieving the dream helps colleges transform themselves according to the principles of institutional improvement through achieving the dream s fivestep process while no two institutions are alike by following the achieving the dream fivestep process for increasing student success institutions large and small rural and urban single campus and multicampus are helping more students realize success the steps are as follows step 1 commit to improving student outcomes the first step in the achieving the dream improvement process is for the college s leadership to make a clear commitment to improving student outcomes college leaders are expected to make the improvement of student outcomes an institutional priority and to communicate that priority to internal and external stakeholders leadership support for the initiative sends a signal to faculty staff and others that achieving the dream is more than just another project step 2 use data to prioritize actions once the college has made a commitment to improving student outcomes the next step is to make an honest and forthright assessment of performance with respect to student outcomes identify barriers to student achievement and opportunities for improvement and explicitly articulate those that will be addressed as priorities step 3 engage stakeholders to help develop a plan the third step in the achieving the dream pr ocess for increasing student success is to engage internal and external stakeholders in the development of strategies for addressing priority problems and improving student achievement step 4 implement evaluate and improve strategies achieving the dream institutions have found it most effective to focus their energies on implementing a limited number of strategies usually two to four at many institutions the core team initially oversees the implementation of strategies as time goes on a standing committee or another established body responsible for monitoring student success at the college should take on this role step 5 establish a culture of continuous improvement as strategies prove successful and are brought to scale colleges are expected to repeat the initial steps of this process identifying new problem areas and developing testing and expanding effective approaches to addressing those problems  one goal succeess for all community college students  achieving the dream seeks to help more students earn postsecondary credentials including occupational certificates and degrees since community college students often take several years to earn certificates or degrees achieving the dream works with institutions to improve student progression through intermediate milestones these indicators include the rates at which students successfully complete remedial or developmental instruction and advance to creditbearing courses enroll in and successfully complete the initial collegelevel or gatekeeper courses in subjects such as math and english complete the courses they take with a grade of c or better

share set goals follow your dream work hard accept help and don t let a little thing like a serious car accident derail you now just 22 years old and a k n pro series east official with nascar ramsey claims he was born racing with an uncle and cousin who raced he always wanted to be behind the wheel as an adolescent he and his dad started gokart racing just for fun and it soon morphed into competition while other kids were hanging out at the mall i was getting dirty behind the wheel of a gokart he said at age 12 he was advised by his father that if he wanted to continue he would have to get his own sponsors he did that by approaching family and friends and one day on a return trip from the wka world karting association world nationals in daytona he hit pay dirt on the plane a stranger noticed his wka ball cap and struck up a conversation with ramsey and his father this stranger soon became a benefactor and over time supplied tires a chassis and even an engine to the young driver as ramsey says he was beatin and bangin on a gokart track before he earned his drivers license graduating from gokart to race car ramsey logged some time in 2008 and 2009 as a crew member with taylor brothers motorsports out of madison virginia in that job he worked with tires race car preparation and repair in the shop and other common race track duties but racing is extremely competitive and ramsey opted next to enroll in general education courses with an eye to go into the emergency medical services program at central virginia community college cvcc recognizing that his heart was really on the track instead of the in back of an ambulance ramsey gave up his seat in the paramedic classroom and instead enrolled at the university of northwestern ohio in the high performance engine program unused to the frigid temperatures and all the snow ramsey soon discovered that he would have to take regular mechanic classes for one year before he was ever allowed to touch a race car that s when a family friend said why aren t you at patrick henry community college in martinsville they work on nascar late models and are right beside a truck series team that s where you need to be after learning about phcc s pulldown rig shock dynameters and telemetry system ramsey determined that phcc was where he could learn more about the technical setup aspect of the race car and expand his knowledge he enrolled in phcc s motorsports program in fall 2009 and because his instructor talmage thomas knew about his past experience with taylor brothers he was turning wrenches on a brand new race car on his first day in the second year of the program students study under lou larosa known in racing circles for his work as engine builder for dale earnhardt and kale yarborough racing engines were new to ramsey and he would come out of class each night with a headache larosa made the students think so much they would be steaming ramsey said but he is proud to be able to say that lou larosa taught him everything he knows about a racing engine just as he was getting a good start in the program ramsey who had always wanted to be behind the wheel fell asleep behind it on his way to class in his second semester ramsey woke up sitting in the middle of the road he was airlifted out and en route to the hospital couldn t help but worry will i walk again live my dream is shattered it turned out that his physical injuries were not as serious as he feared although they did keep him bedridden and wheelchairbound for some time what didn t happen was the loss of classroom time thanks to thomas who showed up at ramsey s bedside to give him lesson plans he could work on from home he kept saying when are you coming back we want ya we need ya to come back ramsey said and so he did wheelchair crutches and all it s not easy poking around in a race car from a wheelchair and ramsey s classmates offered lots of support after dubbing him bootie barker after the sprint cup series crew chief in a wheelchair and lieutenant dan after the character in the forrest gump story i couldn t have asked for a better place to be to have that kind of thing happen and to be fortunate enough to come back when i got back i picked right up and kept diggin ramsey earned his associate in applied science in technical studies motorsports technology in may 2011 a friend of a friend of a friend who happened to be a nascar official suggested that he put his name in for a job at nascar a bit skeptical what are my chances of ever landing a job at nascar ramsey procrastinated for a few months until he was urged to fill out an application again when invited for an interview ramsey who had never had a job interview before found himself in a chance facetoface encounter with mike helton president of nascar when he opened the door and wished him a good morning that was kind of an oh boy moment ramsey marvels after a series of interviews and multiple nervewracking trips in ensuing months to the mailbox looking for a job offer ramsey finally landed his position in the k n pro series working with the nascar family is a dreamcome true he says not only is he employed by the largest sanctioning body of stock car racing in the united states he gets to travel from track to track throughout the season from march through november as for others who may be seeking a job in the racing industry or following a dream of any kind for that matter ramsey has this advice never give up always work harder than the next guy believe in yourself learn the work ethic these are things that lou larosa taught him he said along with always be doing something and never stand around with your hands in your pockets if you are 15 minutes early you are late and this from drew himself don t do only what s

encarnacion pyle steve newman never expected to be going back to college in his 50s to train for a new job but the 51yearold hilliard resident also never expected to get laid off three years ago after 25 years as a civil engineer fortunately my wife and i had been making provisions for an undefined emergency since the middle of the previous summer so we were not without resources newman said with high unemployment low home values and downsized retirement accounts hundreds of thousands of baby boomers are turning to college to boost their job skills the number of students ages 50 to 64 increased 17 percent nationwide between fall 2007 and fall 2009 according to the latest data available from the national center for education statistics the growth has been even more dramatic at columbus state community college the number of students age 50 or older increased more than 81 percent to 1506 students between fall 2007 and fall last year that age group is the fastestgrowing population at the school it used to be that many older adults came to college to help pass the time during their retirement and to enrich their lives said chandra bell a counselor and careerassistance coordinator at columbus state but people are now coming back because they have lost their jobs need new skills to keep their jobs or are planning a new career because they can t afford to retire as planned bell said with 78 million baby boomers entering their retirement years the country not to mention ohio needs more of these experienced workers to stay in the work force longer even in parttime positions officials said keeping older workers engaged in the labor force is vital for the continued economic growth of our region said bill lafayette a columbus economist and owner of the consulting firm regionomics the labor force growth rate is already declining and is projected to slow to a crawl between 2020 and 2025 because of the exodus of baby boomers he said with people living longer healthier lives there is also a new demand for programs designed to train the over50 population said celia crossley a career strategist and managing partner of crosworks in columbus last year about 36 percent of workers said they expected to keep working past age 65 compared with 20 percent in 2001 according to the employee benefit research institute it s a different world today where 50 to 70 is considered the new middle age crossley said martha harrison 52 of powell started playing with the idea of going back to college in 2005 after more than 20 years as a preschool teacher she was motivated by two primary factors money and a desire to get a counseling degree to help children deal with their increasingly complicated home lives preschool teachers barely make above minimum wage which makes no sense when you think about taking care of someone s mostvaluable asset harrison said she tried a few online psychology classes with a forprofit college in 2005 but didn t really get started on her education until she enrolled at columbus state s delaware campus in fall 2010 harrison has enjoyed school so much she wants to transfer to ohio state to work on a bachelor s degree and eventually earn a master s so she can become a school counselor she isn t daunted by her age the way i look at it people my age we have maybe 25 or more years left of working in us especially in something that we enjoy she said when newman lost his job he and his wife deb who is a stayathome mom had saved about half of what they thought they might need to sustain themselves for about six months with no other income we were glad to have made such decisions despite not having had time to complete our preparation he said through friends newman immediately landed a job as a marketing director for a men s legwear company in granville he took a job 11 months later as a traffic engineer for the ohio department of transportation but neither worked out long term so the father of four signed up for a free threeweek program at columbus state that was created to train dislocated workers in logistics the movement and storage of goods from the beginning to the end of a supply chain after the training newman got a job as an inventory specialist at odw logistics inc in columbus he then enrolled in a threequarterlong online certificate program at columbus state which helped him move to a moreadvanced job at the pharmaceutical company of boehringer ingelheim roxane inc even though newman had earned a bachelor s degree from ohio state in 1984 going back to college was challenging he said in the past 13 days i ve had to read seven chapters take nine quizzes solve four sets of problems take one midterm and two finals and that doesn t even count working 40 hours and spending time with my family newman is just thankful for a second chance even though he s making 60000 a year less than his peak salary as a civil engineer he s also looking forward to working his way up in what he hopes turns out to be a long successful second career getting laid off was quite a blow he said but finding something else to go after and making strides to move ahead has me feeling

INSERT INTO `search_dataset` VALUES (2953,'node',' reforms with promise by anthony bryk and thomas toch the obama administration is right to make community colleges a cornerstone of its plan to close skill gaps and put people back to work the nation s 1200 community colleges enroll 67 million students or nearly half the us undergraduate population they are key institutions in today s educationintensive economy but there is a gaping hole in the community college pipeline some 60 percent of incoming community college students must complete one or more remedial courses before working toward degrees and upwards of 70 percent of students in these developmental math courses don t complete them as a result the higher education careers of many students are over before they begin researchers at teachers college columbia university have attracted wide coverage for a recent study arguing that as many as one in four community college students placed in remedial courses would pass regular collegelevel classes if given the chance to enroll in them but whether that s true or not vast numbers of students arrive at community colleges woefully unprepared and there s little chance of substantially expanding the community college sector s role in economic development unless we help students catch up the solution lies in rethinking remedial education with the support of five national philanthropies the carnegie foundation for the advancement of teaching has launched a national network of 27 community colleges and three universities dedicated to helping students at the greatest risk of failure in math the approach uses a comprehensive strategy of support for students and faculty members in a networked improvement community it s early in the life of the project but the results so far are encouraging the strategy starts with dramatically altering the nature of instruction teaching students the same content the same way over and over is obviously not working those who failed to move beyond arithmetic in middle school and who didn t grasp key concepts any more fully during reteaching in high school are unlikely to master them if they are presented in the same abstract and rote fashion once more in community college instead the carnegie network s instruction and online outofclass resources focus on the statistics and quantitative reasoning that matters most for students work personal and civic lives there are units on seven billion and counting the credit crunch and has the minimum wage kept up students learn math through themes such as citizenship and personal finance it s rigorous stuff but relevant and engaging requiring students to use the tools of algebra statistics data visualizations and analysis to solve meaningful realworld problems as a way of thinking mathematically the network is also using a number of promising psychological and motivational strategies to overcome students pervasive math anxiety and other debilitating stereotypic beliefs and give them the confidence and drive they need to work hard and be successful the effort includes helping faculty members create positive and productive learning environments through carefully designed teambuilding activities protocols for classroom discussions classroom contracts that foster camaraderie and group responsibility and other strategies to the same end the network is reconceptualizing students homework assignments replacing traditional rote exercises with problem and scenariobased exercises that extend classroom learning we re taking the obvious but oftenneglected step of helping the many community college students for whom english isn t their first language navigate communication barriers and the project has abandoned the traditional model of the independent faculty member working in isolation in favor of a network strategy that allows faculty to work together across campuses to build common instructional systems and improve the program in real time through the network s ongoing collection of student and faculty feedback including strategies such as quick surveys delivered via students cell phones and other information on instruction instructional materials and student performance importantly community colleges in the project grant college credit toward certificates and degrees to students who complete the new rigorous yearlong carnegie pathways saving students the oftendemoralizing delay of taking noncredit classes the norm for remedial courses in higher education colleges pay just over 20000 a year the equivalent of about a halfdozen student tuitions to participate in the network some pay less by increasing the success rate in developmental courses the network helps colleges extend student enrollments and increase graduation rates giving them a potentially substantial return on their investment the network s early results are promising even with a largely highrisk student population nearly half the students in network colleges are from households with incomes below 40000 a year and only 10 percent have mothers with at least a bachelor s degree yet 89 percent remained enrolled for the full fall term the program rolled out in the network s colleges at the beginning of the 201112 school year and 68 percent finished the first semester with a grade of c or better required for college credit nearly double the 36 percent of students earning the same grades in the lessdemanding courses taught previously in the network s schools the students who completed the new courses scored nearly as high on an independent endofsemester exam as a national sample of community college and university students who had completed collegelevel statistics coursework and 88 percent of the students earning c s or better moved on to the second half of the twosemester credityielding course that s more than triple the proportion of students in the network s colleges who successfully navigated a first term of remedial math and signed up for a second before the network s creation and we know from surveys that the program s confidencebuilding components increase students enthusiasm for math and make students less anxious about the subject and more likely to believe that with hard work they could master it a complete turnaround from the typical perspectives of students in traditional developmental math classes the test of the new network model will be sustaining these early results as we scale from 1600 students today to our target of 62000 a year by 201718 but the encouraging early evidence suggests that it is possible to reverse the pernicious culture of failure among community college students that a comprehensive improvement strategy can put them on a surer path to a truly higher

students face in completing their education   students are at a loss at the initial start of college with lack of advisement a student cannot form a plan in which they create successful strategies students don t know what classes they should take towards a major lack of orientation finance lack of money not enough financial aid strict requirements for financial aid books for classes too many editions teachers never use it too expensive not online problems getting them  2 what can government officials do to improve college completion rates in florida   lower tuition rates no extra fees no higher rates and stop increasing rates on loans increase the money for education budget instead of using it for other purposes ie jail incarceration the students need that money the passage of the dream act rally support within the state for the dream act create laws to protect undocumented students  3 what can administration officials faculty and staff at academic institutions do to help improve completion rates at our schools   advisement needs to improve training should be enforced because faculty and staff need to be more motivated to help students succeed stop standardizing education instead provide students with a well rounded and civically engaged education  4 what can millennials do to ensure we achieve our individual and collective academic goals   become a leader and take a stand involve yourself in memberships such as clubs and mentorships in order to network and professionalize yourself millennials shall not be afraid to invest in the future find grants for

that regulars at her restaurant were coming in one day a week instead of three or four her 26yearold daughter had taken a fall and fractured her neck pick up your baby and you could end up paralyzed  her doctor told her that s why porter was standing in the steamy kitchen of the town fryer at the agora stirring pots of gumbo and red beans and rice with a 1yearold on her hip she was 52 and single had no health insurance and her 10yearold jeep was emptying her wallet faster than a thief if all that wasn t worrying her her daughter s health was what if ali didn t recover how could porter support her and her baby for years on the little money she was bringing in  this is insane  porter told herself i can t live like this i ve got to do something she has in a few weeks susie porter leaves for upstate new york to begin her junior year of college on a full scholarship room and board included at an ivy league research university cornell if you have a dream if you had a dream it s never too late to go for it porter says my god i m 54 years old and i m going off to college it all happened because a friend stopped by the restaurant as he did every morning and told her he was going back to school that he d gotten enough financial aid to make it work you can get grants and you can get loans and you ll be ok he told porter on that cold january morning 212 years ago i ll show you how porter sat down next to him right there in the restaurant with her granddaughter on her lap and applied to cleveland state university  her next piece of good fortune was getting an adviser who explained csu s partnership program with cuyahoga community college  which allowed porter to take less expensive tric courses that counted toward a csu degree porter jumped on that but even with the lower tuition she needed grants and loans to make it the first semester she enrolled in three online classes taking nine credit hours so she could continue to take care of her daughter and granddaughter and because she was nervous about starting college in her 50s it had been 34 years since i had been in high school she says and i was wondering if i could still learn she got straight a s and she kept at it choosing urban affairs as her major her grades were good enough to get her into the honors program as well as induction into phi theta kappa  the academic honor society for twoyear colleges she was accepted into the robert l lewis academy of scholars  too scholarship money started coming in after that then in september 2011 she opened the mailbox and pulled out a letter from cornell inviting her to apply to its school of industrial and labor relations it was a perfect fit she d always been interested in workers rights and social justice yeah right porter said when she d finished reading and she laughs a soft sweet laugh that hints at her texas and louisiana roots with her daughter healed and the restaurant closed she went ahead and called the admissions office just as the letter suggested the following month she made the 5 12hour drive to ithaca ny  to check out the campus she was sold it s huge porter says but even in its enormity it feels like you are just absolutely enveloped in this nurturing environment it feels like it just wraps itself around you in february she sent in her application weeks later on a friday night she looked down at her cellphone and saw she d missed a call she checked voicemail ian schachner the associate director for admissions for the school of industrial and labor relations wanted to talk to her this can t be good  porter thought you get the fat envelope in the mail when you re accepted and she fretted all weekend when she called back on monday schachner told her he didn t want her to wait for an answer any longer cornell wanted her when he hung up porter says i cried like a baby porter knew her acceptance meant she d get financial help too because of cornell s policy of providing scholarships to students who can t afford tuition room and board that letter came later the total value of the school s offer 56497 for just the first year schachner says porter is the kind of student cornell searches for we talk a lot about diversity in education and diversity is often spoken of as race or ethnicity he said in a telephone interview but it also means diversity in life experiences we love students who have been out there for a while people who can help the younger students realize hey this is actually what goes on in organizations this is how the world really works his message to other students forget about the barriers you think are there there s an enormous number of fears that they have i can t afford it they d never take me i wouldn t be able to do the work i don t have the support schachner says the only thing that matches the number of fears they have is the actual support that exists to help them and that support porter says is a gift she never would have received if not for the people who helped her along the way and if not for tric ian told me that he had rarely seen a transfer student come in with as many transferable credits as i had she says that really says a lot for tric and it means more students like her can get into schools like cornell porter says she s willing to help them do it she s offering advice now on the blog she just created  susiep54posterouscom  if you work hard there s money available to go to school she says she wants to alert older students to hurdles besides money that they need to dig up high school transcripts for example and find old immunization records it s funny how people put labels on people porter says thinking back to everyone who knew her as the fry lady the woman who deepfried twinkies and oreos along with her famous chicken and baseballsized servings of homemade macaroni and cheese at the town fryer restaurant she ran for years on superior avenue they can t get past people having more than one side to them what s even more interesting is that it s hard for people to realize that they have more than one side to themselves they think they re too old to go back to school not porter in august she ll be in classrooms filled with 20yearold college juniors and in two years she ll have her bachelor s degree and have figured out what she ll do next law school is not out of the question she says

INSERT INTO `search_dataset` VALUES (3460,'node',' assembly line manufacturing industry taps collegs for help with alternative credential potential disruptions to higher education typically portend a diminished role for the academy in workforce training as students ditch college for well something else but one of the most promising alternative credentialing movements the manufacturing industry s system of stackable certificates has actually led to a deeper more symbiotic relationship between employers and colleges the growing partnership has also given rise to a blended model of higher education where the manufacturing industry takes the lead on standards for competencybased education with a helping hand from colleges which then provide the traditional degree path for example harper college a community college in illinois last month launched a program where students can earn industryendorsed certificates in manufacturing and 54 companies have agreed to hire students from the twoyear college as paid interns as soon as students complete the first level certificate which at 16 credits can be earned in less than four months if harper students thrive in their internships and are able to progress in their manufacturing careers without earning more credentials everybody wins except for the college s graduation rate but even better if students decide to continue their educations and work toward more advanced certificates or degrees this hybrid approach with both employers and colleges at the table is a promising way to bridge the worlds of workplace competencies and postsecondary education louis soares a senior fellow at the center for american progress wrote in a recent report  going it alone  that s not to say that manufacturers and colleges always see eyetoeye in fact many companies feel higher education has failed to create a pipeline of skilled workers an estimated 600000 manufacturing jobs are currently unfilled we re dealing with an industry that has lost a lot of faith in working with education said jacey wilkins a spokeswoman for the manufacturing institute which is affiliated with the national association of manufacturers in particular wilkins said manufacturers have been frustrated with the dismantling of vocational education so the institute decided to take matters into its own hands and came up with standards for the education of manufacturing employees the group created its manufacturing skills certification system in 2009 the stackable credentials include four tiers of competency for applicants and veteran employees to demonstrate ranging from basic aptitude like showing that they can get to work on time and work in teams to proving that they have hightech skills in specialized manufacturing fields  like machinery or medical technology the certifications are stackable because they build on each other with each level presumably having value but also leading to a next step which can in turn lead to promotions on the job plenty of praise rolled in for the certification system including from president obama but there s a problem manufacturers themselves have been slow to recognize the certification relying on the old standby of collegeissued certificates and degrees many of which do not address the key competencies needed in manufacturing jobs that s where higher education most notably the university of phoenix and a growing number of community colleges has stepped in to give the stackable credential system a fighting chance to become widely accepted the institute s stackable credentials are designed to match up with curriculums at colleges as well as high schools at the entry level and in recent months the industry has signed up higher education partners to strengthen those curricular links phoenix for example last year announced a new bachelor degree track  the bachelor of science in management with a concentration in manufacturing sector that incorporates competencies from the industry s credential system soares calls the partnership between phoenix and the institute a major step up in the development of stackable credentials creating the new curriculum to align with the certification system wasn t easy said tim welsh senior vice president for phoenix s national industry strategy group it required a substantial financial investment for the university to put faculty members and administrators to work building competencies into the degree program in a way that met manufacturers needs as result phoenix needed to be sure the final product had value for both students and employers for us it keeps the university of phoenix relevant to the needs of industry welsh said we really do want to get this right early returns have been positive with manufacturers backing the degree and phoenix doesn t plan to stop with one industry welsh said the university is planning to work with national associations for other industries to create similar tailored degrees with retail energy defense and health care as possibilities 16credit certificate there are 80000 unfilled manufacturing jobs in illinois alone a striking number for a state that has been walloped by the recession s lingering effects that s why harper college recently sat down with local manufacturers to look for an answer you ve got to find local solutions to these problems said kenneth ender president of the college which is about 30 miles northwest of chicago part of the reason companies can t find applicants who are prepared to enter manufacturing is that relatively few college students are interested in the industry often because they have outdated ideas about it and think the jobs are dirty menial and probably deadends so the college decided to create a stackable and portable  system of credentials where students can give manufacturing a whirl and find out if they really like it ender said while manufacturing may be a tough sell the promise of a paid internship helps college officials worked with industry partners to create an entrylevel certificate that gave students enough safety skills and a basic idea of technical measurement and quality control including some mathematics so that they could go to work as interns after only one semester of coursework the college also designed several morespecialized certificates in four fields  mechatronics automation precision machining metal fabrication and supply chain management the justlaunched program includes at least two certificates in each specialization which range from 6 to 15 credits to earn there are two further layers in the stack students can earn a manufacturingoriented associate of applied science degree from harper or transfer to a fouryear institution to pursue a bachelor s degree perhaps in engineering the idea is that many students will continue to work in manufacturing jobs while earning their degrees and harper has booked articulation agreements on the manufacturing pathway with both northern illinois university and roosevelt university harper s manufacturing credentials were created to match up with the industry s competencybased skills certification system manufacturers served on panels at the college and contributed to the curriculum s design ender said some of the companies were not aware of the industry s own stackable system they endorsed it and were amazed that they didn t know about it he said  part of the supply chain  phoenix and harper are not alone in partnering with the manufacturing industry wilkins said about 115 institutions mostly twoyear colleges have incorporated elements of the institute s system into academic programs we re talking about system change here that doesn t happen overnight she said eventually we ll get to the point where this is the standard for manufacturing education but the sluggish start for the system has shown that the business sector probably needs higher education to get an alternative credential off the ground as further proof few industries are more geared to going it alone than manufacturing information technology and certified financial planning also are industries where companies and associations issue credentials but even those two fields have made moves toward credentialing pathways in higher education phoenix for example recently inked an agreement with cisco the computer networking company to create the first associate degree program that will also serve as a cisco networking certificate and a spokesman for the certified financial planner board of standards said his organization had seen a rise in the number of bachelor and advanced degree programs that are designed to train financial planners observers said the ideal outcome of partnerships like those between the manufacturers and colleges is degree programs that are better geared to jobs and that test competencies that are vetted by employers welsh said phoenix increasingly sees itself as part of a supply chain of talent for the broader economy adding that there s so much demand out there and supply chains don t work without suppliers which when it comes to training workers tend to be colleges we re operating in a society that still values college wilkins said read more  http wwwinsidehigheredcom news 20120718 manufacturingindustrytapscollegeshelpalternativecr ixzz21ch3klpp inside higher ed http wwwinsidehigheredcom news 20120718

when we as americans need to retain our competitive and creative edge steps must be taken in order to ensure the success of the future business leaders of america the poor performance of america s schools cannot be attributed to lack of money thrown at the problem the united states tops the world in spending per student on education yet is perpetually stuck with mediocre or poor showings on standardized tests according to the organisation for economic cooperation and development s international education rankings the united states has fallen to average   in addition much of that money is being wasted on administrative overhead rather than going to pay teachers and buy books developing new pathways for comprehensive education reform has never been more critical for the united states for many community college is sometimes the only viable path to educational advancement in fact  nearly half of the entire united states undergraduate student population is enrolled in community colleges  and these institutions are diverse some offer technical workforce credentials while others maintain comprehensive sets of transfer and career training programs  one such school is valencia college  which was awarded the 2011 aspen prize for community college excellence as the nation s top community college and it offers a case study of the possibilities of community college education and the implications for america s businesses valencia in partnership with local companies has developed a focused curriculum that offers training in specific areas a huge advantage for those who cannot attend fouryear programs valencia s advantages are emblematic of the community college model and the opportunities these institutions can provide particularly for lower income families graduates of community colleges and other technical educational programs are wellpositioned to provide the kind of workforce that businesses are looking for while earning a good living in fact a sectoral employment impact study found that educational programs with curriculum specifically tailored to employer needs raised earnings by 4000  and the brookings institution s metropolitan policy program estimates that associate degree holders earn 20 to 30 percent more than those with only a high school diploma there are even some reports that indicate that because these programs provide technical training and practical skills  community college graduates earn a higher salary  on average than graduates of traditional fouryear institutions up to 10000 more per year obviously it s not just the students who benefit this is also a boon for employers northrup grumman has started hiring directly from valencia  allowing them to avoid spending half the year on the road looking for workers qualified to become laser technicians for military hardware career program advisers are embedded in each technical department to help students stay on track and many advisers have had prior experience in the industry enabling them to keep an eye on career trends and maintain connections that could benefit students even more traditional universities including wake forest university southern methodist university and hiram college are also beginning to incorporate an entrepreneurial focus because it appeals to many students in understanding business and opening opportunities for jobs this is also giving way to institutions that are solely focused on producing future leaders of a global freeenterprise society  like northwood university  which has campuses in florida michigan and texas in general most other countries place far more emphasis on vocational education than we do in america the logic driving this kind of educational system is that from the later teenage years onward young people learn best in structured programs that combine work and learning where learning is contextual and applied ultimately this helps create better jobs and more importantly a better workforce the american dream rests on the promise of economic opportunity with a middle class lifestyle for those willing to work for it yet millions of today s youth are entering the workforce without marketable skills i firmly believe along with my fellow business leaders at job creators alliance  that the current state of the american education system is on a downward trend and losing sight of the very important goal of preparing students to lead productive and prosperous lives in order to make this transition a strategy must be implemented to engage educators and employers in a

INSERT INTO `search_dataset` VALUES (3536,'node',' study on college placement exams energizes debate about their effectiveness the ongoing discussion about the effectiveness of college placement exams got a welcome boost this week with a new report that illuminates efforts to rethink how the tests should be used to determine if students need remedial education part of the discussion in the report questions the effectiveness of remedial education itself the report titled  where to begin the evolving role of placement exams for students starting college   was produced by jobs for the future a boston mass based education policy group that is one of several nonprofits working to dramatically increase the number of lowincome youth and adults who attain a postsecondary credential over the next decade a college placement exam critic as well as a representative from the maker of a commonlyused college placement exam both said the report represents a timely look at an area of higher education that is overdue for reform we ve been advocating for almost everything that s been indicated in the report for quite a few years now said david parmele executive director in the accuplacer program for the college board the accuplacer is a college placement exam produced by the college board we do not believe that the placement score alone should be the only factor used to decide a student s placement into collegelevel classes parmele said echoing a key aspect of the report namely how some systems are weighing the merits of moving away from the widespread practice of using the test scores as the only basis for assigning students to remedial classes and toward using multiple measures such as high school grades dr lingchi wang professor emeritus in asian american studies at uc berkeley and a longtime critic of college placement exams also praised the report i thought it was high time somebody raised this issue and questioned the validity and the quality of the effectiveness and in some cases the abuse of remedial tests to sometimes prevent people from moving forward academically or even prevent people from getting admitted to college wang said wang said college placement tests tend to hurt immigrant and lowincome students the most by keeping them out of college or landing them in a series of burdensome noncreditbearing remedial education courses despite the fact that research has shown students can be remediated within the framework of regular creditbearing courses everybody knows that your test score is really directly correlated with your income and of course your immigration status wang said those are the most important factors in deciding whether you pass all theses tests or not the report s author pamela burdman a chicagobased consultant on issues of college readiness and success said the report is meant to provoke discussion on the usefulness of college placement tests at a time when greater emphasis is being placed on the value of a college degree and when research is showing that remedial education is often ineffective i think high stakes decisions are being made about students futures on the basis of fairly thin evidence burdman said amplifying one of the key points of her report i think the field is moving more in the direction of finding ways to give students the benefit of the doubt in other words if their exam score is low but their grades are high do we find a way to interpret that so that this student can be successful she continued if our goal is trying to help students get to a degree a lot of colleges are saying shouldn t we be trying these approaches to help students get to these points rather than saying we need to enforce these standards and i don t know if these students are up to snuff although the report is largely directed at community colleges it has implications for fouryear institutions as well burdman said the report cites some of the latest research in the field and gives examples of higher education systems that are wrestling with how to make the best use of college placement exams it also deals with the merits of alternative approaches from downplaying the tests by reducing reliance on placement scores to mainstreaming students into regular classes with support a practice that the report says evidence has shown can potentially work with some students whose test scores are below the cutoff the report also gives a nod to the tradeoffs and tensions associated with changing the status quo one such tension concerns the battle between effectiveness and efficiency the latter being one of the hallmarks of using a single test and a cutoff score as opposed to other methods that involve more discretion there s still a place for college placement exams but they need to be used in the right combination with all of these other factors the college board s parmele said no one s found that secret formula as to what works best burdman conceded similar thoughts one of the reasons colleges rely on placement exams in the first place is that it s efficient and transparent burdman said it s sort of seen as fair whereas if you start introducing a more complex system it takes more staff time and more money which many colleges just don t have secondly it opens up the opportunity for people to question the fairness burdman said of moving away from rigid cutoff scores and toward more flexibility and discretion i do think college systems are being very cautious about this because they don t want to wade into an area where they re seen as using an amount of discretion that leads to unfairness or inequality  http diverseeducationcom article 17265c1 studyoncollegeplacementexamsene  diverse issues in higher education  ',0);

INSERT INTO `search_dataset` VALUES (3594,'node',' the problem with community college placement tests placement tests have traditionally been used by community colleges nationwide to determine whether recent high school graduates are prepared for the rigors of college coursework  the results of these examinations has landed many incoming college freshman into remedial or developmental classes designed to bring their academic skills up to par before embarking on more challenging collegelevel classes however recent evidence suggests that those remedial classes may be having a much larger and negative influence on college completion rates overall additional research has shown that these placement examinations may not even be the most accurate assessment of college readiness for the majority of students today college placement exams study other measurements more accurate  a new study from achieving the dream  a nonprofit organization was created to improve community college outcomes for lowincome students  the study titled where to begin the evolving role of placement exams for students starting college found that tests commonly used by colleges to determine incoming student placement may be inaccurate and create hurdles to student success in college the study found that other factors including high school grades may be better measures of success the study looked at students from the long beach unified school district that attended long beach city college after high school the study found that ninety percent of the students had to take five semester or more of remedial classes before they could embark on their college coursework the study also found that if the college had relied on grade point averages rather than placement exam scores to allow freshmen to move right into college curriculum the number of freshmen in college classes would have risen by as much as 500 percent with educational reformers keenly focused on remedial education new research using longitudinal data systems questions the efficacy and fairness of the very tests on which the system of remedial education relies pamela burdman author of the study was reported as saying at edsource burdman added that the results of this study were so stunning additional studies will soon be launched on 22 community colleges within the state of california  placement exams and completion rates for many years the issue of placement examinations was not addressed because educators did not link these examinations to overall college completion rates however with increased focus on completion  schools are now forced to take a look at whether remedial education has an impact on the number of students that actually go on to complete their degree programs as that link began to be studied it became apparent that there was a direct association between students that had to take multiple remedial courses and those that never finished their college degree according to california watch  only 25 percent of students that are required to take remedial reading courses in community college ever moved to a transferlevel english course by the same token only 10 percent of students taking a remedial math class ever moved to a collegelevel course for schools that already feature a dismal completion rate of around 30 percent the impact of remedial coursework could profoundly affect those numbers the study reported in the california watch found many potential problems with college placement examinations including exam inconsistency from school to school and lack of preparation and awareness of exams by students many students didn t realize they had to take the tests and did not prepare for them ahead of time even after completing exams a number of students didn t realize how much impact those scores would have on their overall community college experience five challenges to placement exams the study by achieve the dream categorized five elements that result in the problems with the placement exams as they are today  high stakes  these placement examinations are currently seen as lowstakes exams so students are unaware of the repercussions if they don t perform well on the tests effectiveness of developmental education  the study also suggests the developmental or remedial education in its current state may be an ineffective tool in improving college success positive indications  early studies seem to suggest that allowing students to accelerate through remedial education or skip it entirely could improve student outcomes poor indicators  studies also suggest that placement examinations are poor indicators of academic success and that other measuring tools may be more effective incomplete picture  placement examinations may not provide a complete picture of potential student success since they don t accurately measure intangibles like persistence motivation and critical thinking skills hope for the future fortunately in the midst of much bleak news on placement exams there is a bright spot in the recent study researchers also looked at ways to change the system to make it more accurate and conducive to increased completion rates some states are also becoming innovative in the way they approach college readiness  for example  education week reports that north carolina is now working with college board to design a new type of interactive exam that will better reflect the curriculum taught in the state new jersey has plans to factor high school grades into examination scores a community college is texas is also using a similar system for students that fall into the grey zone of college readiness other schools are trying new ideas like providing online study guides for placement exams and offering remedial coursework in tandem with college classes for students that do require additional help college readiness is an important factor in college success but measuring readiness is an imperfect process perhaps research like this will help educators find the most effective ways for measuring readiness to provide students with the best chance of success in the future  http wwwcommunitycollegereviewcom articles 488

INSERT INTO `search_dataset` VALUES (3701,'node',' can do for community colleges in the spotlight more than ever before community colleges are increasingly being asked to do more with less facing greater pressure to produce more college graduates at the same time that state funding is being reduced for example arizona s state spending on community colleges in fiscal 2013 dropped 7 percent from 71 million to about 66 million in spite of a 7 percent increase in community college enrollment in virginia the average state funding per student at community colleges fell 36 percent from 4602 to 2946 between 2006 and 2011 and in the last four years demand for community college education in california has increased while the budgets have been cut by 12 percent many institutions nationwide cite such hurdles to justify threeyear graduation rates dipping as low as 15 percent saying it s impossible to do better but that s not true even in the face of all the challenges there are examples of community colleges doing a superb job achieving student success at scale on campuses across the country the sector is inventing programs that show promising results yet community colleges are still being recognized more for their challenges than their successes what community colleges need is a better sense of where to look for examples of excellence in the sector in order to raise the bar not only for college completion but also for student learning outcomes and employment after college in july the aspen institute published data that offer some pointers on where to look for solutions performance and improvement metrics were released that detail which 120 community colleges are doing best and improving the most in terms of graduation rates retention rates and degrees awarded for all students and for minority populations that have historically performed at lower levels the data are used to determine the top us community colleges that are eligible for the 2013 aspen prize for community college excellence the data set aspen released which is based on the integrated postsecondary education data system ipeds does not tell the whole story but it tells an important one it shows community colleges across the country what levels of student success are possible as well as some places they ought to look to as models for example the data show that walla walla community college wash boasts a 54 percent threeyear graduation and transfer rate well above the national average of 40 percent santa barbara city college calif has a threeyear graduation and transfer rate of 48 percent for hispanic students which make up over 30 percent of its student body lake area technical institute sd has a threeyear graduation and transfer rate of 76 percent even though over 40 percent of its students are lowincome enough to be receiving pell grants not every example on this list of 120 is relevant to every community college but every twoyear college in the country can find examples in the aspen data set of a place that looks a lot like they do yet is achieving higher levels of student graduation or retention or degrees awarded or minority student success they can then work to figure out what those colleges are doing that allowed them to be so successful and examine the programs that are working well helping students learn complete programs and obtain degrees for example even after consecutive years of budget cuts in california santa barbara city college has maintained an excellent range of programs to improve student success including an accelerated track that helps speed the neediest students through developmental math and an exceptional writing center that prepares students for the rigors of upperdivision classes if and when they transfer to a fouryear college walla walla community college has developed very strong systems for advising students to ensure that they complete degrees employing quarterly advising by case managers and excellent online tools to monitor progress towards credentials with strong labor market value lake area technical institute also prevents students from slipping through the cracks by enrolling all students in cohortbased blockscheduled programs where students progress together through each semester knowing exactly what courses degree and career lie ahead valencia college the winner of the first aspen prize in 2011 achieved its 51 percent threeyear graduation rate with a highly diverse student population 46 percent of its students are hispanic or africanamerican while many significant and scaled initiatives have contributed to valencia s exceptional student outcomes the college s success is built in substantial part on a culture of learning among professors and staff fueled by a completely revamped tenure process that rewards professors for improving their teaching these institutions as well as the others on the list of 120 have awakened to the realities that we cannot continue to deliver higher education in the same way we always have in this country and expect better student outcomes and community college outcomes need to improve the national fulltime graduation rate of 28 percent is unacceptably low and student success rates remain under 40 percent even if you count students who transfer to a fouryear college without ever completing community college and as has been widely reported graduation rates are even lower for the large number students who enter community college needing remedial education but understanding the need to improve is only the first step by examining the quantitative outcomes of the 120 colleges on this list all community colleges should be able to understand that much higher levels of student success are possible aspen will help over the coming year by releasing toolkits and providing briefings about what is happening at the 10 finalist community colleges vying for the 2013 prize which were just announced  our hope is that increasing amounts of attention will be paid to these exemplars of student success and that more and more people will recognize them as excellent deserving of our investments and places that offer institutionwide

money and casts doubt on the elementary and secondary education systems that we assume will prepare students for college the new england board of higher education nebhe explored solutions to the problem at a recent forum in kennebunkport maine called ready for real innovative strategies for improving remedial education and college success nebhe staff briefed the audience of educators legislators and policymakers on the recent lumina foundation for education grant the regional organization received to support community colleges implementing khan academy materials in developmental math courses nebhe also released a policy brief outlining college placement policies across the region and models for boosting college readiness rethinking developmental ed many colleges use the college board s accuplacer test to determine whether students are ready for creditbearing college courses or first need to take and pass one or more remedial classes in a session on rethinking developmental education state and institutional perspectives  lara couturier program director at jobs for the future offered a national context for remediation she noted that 60 of community college students were referred into developmental education programs  dev ed as she called it once there most never progressed into collegecreditbearing work and only onequarter earned a college degree within eight years a historian by training couturier spoke about different developmental education models including some involving long sequences of courses with too many exit points where students are tempted to drop out and too often do some call dev ed the place where college dreams go to die others couturier among them believe it should be looked at in a more holistic way as an onramp to a structured pathway to graduation virginia has been a leader in a wave of states redesigning developmental education followed by north carolina and florida another promising model is the california acceleration project  which aims to reduce the number of exit points some models involve partnering with local k12 districts so students skills can be assessed in their junior year of high school if at the point the students are deemed not collegeready they can take remedial courses while still in high school others make developmental education a corequisite  a formal course taken simultaneously with another as opposed to a prerequisite the community college of baltimore county for example places developmental students into collegelevel english but also supports them with an hourlong companion course couturier noted that the placement tests that have been relied upon historically may not be the good predictors of success we thought they were she also urged aligning development education with the student s major and career interest the spotlight she suggested should shift to getting development education students into programs of study which means more intentional and frequent advising couturier also noted a dearth of efforts to help students who are severely underprepared feed me data norwalk community college president david levinson who is also vice president for community colleges with the connecticut board of regents for higher education said he was amazed by how little connecticut relied on data when he came aboard in 2004 indeed a selfstudy for the new england association of schools and colleges neasc had not a single bit of data then achieving the dream came along and brought to bear the purpose of research levinson said norwalk community college has tried blending collegelevel courses and developmental courses in learning communities but that was with just over a dozen students the question said levinson is how do you bring that to scale today such issues are being overshadowed in connecticut by legislation calling for all remediation to be confined to a onesemester intensive course not as a sequence we are faced with the really daunting task of not only a new structure that is not even a year old the state s new board of regents for higher education but also this humungous task of trying to implement a piece of legislation that doesn t have a penny attached to it said levinson he noted that connecticut acknowledges enrollment swirling and students starting at one school taking some courses at another and going on to get not only an associate degree but perhaps a bachelor s and master s levinson said that even at his college on connecticut s euphemistically named gold coast 83 of students from norwalk and stamford need at least one precollege course what politicians see in all this he said is the state paying for remedial education twice in high school and college and the students still are not succeeding nashua community college president lucille jordan said she was asked by the new hampshire legislature to identify which students needed developmental education and which high schools they came from problem was she said many have been out of high school for a long time besides what would have been a good enough score in math at one time no longer is nashua community college uses accuplacer diagnostics  providing a detailed analysis of a student s strengths and weaknesses so students can focus on the areas where they are weak jordan also called for embedding reading and study skills in 100level courses she acknowledged that many students may need tutors to stay with them through collegelevel coursework community college of vermont president joyce judy said the vermont legislature has chosen not to get involved in the developmental skills arena per se  focusing more on dual enrollment and multiple pathways we have one shot with those students and if we re not successful in helping them engage and feel like it s relevant to them we ve lost them for another 10 or 15 years said judy some students need a 15week basic skills course others need something different we re asking if accuplacer is nuanced enough to see where strengths and weaknesses are she said she noted that the college is asking developmental english students to do a selfassessment not of their skills but of their practices asking for example if they read newspapers and magazines regularly one size does not fit all said judy in developmental math the community college of vermont is developing a onecredit selfpaced tutorial which judy says students could realistically move through in three weeks that s a challenge she noted for institutions that like to go with 15week courses that are easier to manage but just don t work for all students several attendees said the dev ed conversation should not deal so much with repairing vs preparing  many believe the common core state standards will help with preparation but there will always be adult learners who need some kind of remediation perhaps via new models such as massive open online courses moocs  sharing strategies developmental education can be improved but not eradicated warned rhode island college president nancy carriuolo for one thing dev ed is not just remediation but actually covers a wide range of learning needs exhibited by all learners thomas edison today would have probably been placed in remediation carriuolo asserted because of his deficiencies in reading and writing policymakers often don t know firsthand the distractions lowincome students have families to support drug or alcohol problems low selfesteem and the cumulative effect that comes from not doing well in school carriuolo said adding notice in that brief list i didn t say anything about poor teaching we need to think carefully about what will happen to the most underprepared students who are turned away from community colleges carriuolo reflected will they enter adult basic education to learn the basic skills they need will they enter a training program someplace else or will they simply go home to their couches a bag of potato chips and a life sustained by a welfare check  solving the math problem  at housatonic community college students who went through developmental english passed the gatekeeper college english at a 20 higher rate than those who tested straight into the course without the detour said president anita gliniecki but math was completely opposite she said even if you got through the developmental math your potential to succeed was at least 10 lower than those who tested directly in students noted that the developmental math moved too slowly over the topics they already knew and too quickly over those they didn t know and still don t so housatonic started selfpaced courses in which students test out of items they know and focus on items they don t until they ultimately demonstrate all the competencies faculty also embed in the course measures of how much time students spend on the work to keep an eye not only on skills but also on affective behavior when housatonic allowed students to take an online math refresher programs then retake accuplacer 69 of students increased at least one course level speaking more broadly gliniecki and carriuolo both lamented students failure to estimate urging that high school calculus courses have students put away their calculators a private option deborah hirsch vice president for development at the private fouryear mount ida college said onethird of students there are firstgeneration onethird are pell granteligible and half of entering mount ida students place into developmental education courses but are also enrolled in collegelevel courses mount ida she said has tried to create some linked courses for example offering students guided study skills linked with introductory psychology and because the sequence of developmental math was a bermuda triangle for students mount ida decided to combine the twolevel sequence of developmental math courses into one course the college renovated the classroom with chairs and desks that move easily on wheels laptops and smartboards the class features three days of minilectures and one day of lab mount ida has also added a financial literacy component so it s more relevant to students who

a topic aimed at capturing the interest of students national views at an evening session bruce vandal vice president of complete college america and william trueheart president of achieving the dream addressed a panel on national views on developmental education and improving graduation odds vandal noted the urgency of addressing college readiness particularly in light of the common core state standards assessments coming online in 2014 a study by act suggests that in many states fewer than half of students who take that test will be deemed college ready vandal urged states to focus on developing strategies that effectively transition students from high school to postsecondary institutions including early assessment in high school perhaps 10th grade he also called for better pathways into academic programs by realizing that not all students need the same skills students in social sciences and humanities for example may not need the heavy algebra appropriate for stem students he suggested diversifying the placement tests used to predict success including adding high school gpa trueheart described the mission of achieving the dream to help students many of them lowerincome and students of color to be college ready he held out the example of el paso community college in texas where 98 of students in 200304 needed remedial education partly because so many students at the border institution did not speak english as their first language in 10 years the community college closed achievement gaps in math and english and raised rates of completion

good things new hampshire state rep ralph boehm vice chair of the house education committee told of nashua community college s relationships with honda for car mechanics and delta dental s gift of

INSERT INTO `search_dataset` VALUES (3875,'node',' hispanic heritage month meet eduardo padron college president redefines community colleges  when eduardo padrón left cuba for america at the age of 15 with his younger brother in tow he could have never imagined that one day he would be named one of the top 10 college presidents by time magazine as president of miamidade college today under dr padrón s leadership miami dade college one of the largest colleges in the country with over 174000 students enrolls more minorities than any other institution in the united states and is transforming the model of higher and most importantly help students like him break the cycle of poverty today two thirds of new jobs require some form of postsecondary education padrón 68 begins as he considers the future of higher education we need a public education and higher education system that is wide open and gives opportunities to everyone the economy requires that and if we don t develop educational systems that help minorities help the poor get access to college we re not only sacrificing that human talent but we are really sacrificing our future as nation though miami dade college is one of the largest institutions in the country individual attention and support for students is a priority he said we are creating a culture of success where failure is not an option he said padrón is credited with transforming a once commuter twoyear college then named miamidade community college into an academic powerhouse with a slew of bachelor s degree programs at a fraction of the cost of other universities initiatives such as mandatory orientation and advising individualized education plans and structured curriculum options are keeping students on track and providing them with the kind of personal connections with faculty staff and peers that made all the difference to padrón s success while padrón was once rejected from universities like princeton today some of those same universities have given him honorary phd s a list of his awards and contributions would take up over five full singlespaced12pointfont pages contributions that our world might not have received had padrón not been given the chance at a higher education community college changed my life he says with a melodic spanish accent symbolic of all he s achieved all he s sacrificed and all he represents when it comes to what can be possible for the next generation of hispanic leaders the beginning of the american dream at that time he arrived at age 15 under operation peter pan a program that allowed parents to send unaccompanied children overseas to escape communism padrón was looking to make it in a country his parents promised would offer greater opportunity padrón finished high school in florida and struggled to learn in a new language it was the days before bilingual education or esol classes it was a whole new brave world he said of attending high school in america for the first time i didn t know the language i didn t know the culture and i didn t have my parents with me trying to understand the system was not easy in addition to trying to manage school padrón also worked three to four jobs to support himself and his younger brother i grew up very fast he says of those years i d get up a 4 am go to school and then after that i d iron clothes at a dry cleaner s then wash cars at a car wash and then stock inventory at a department store i spent more hours working than going to school and slept only two to three hours per night it s difficult that anyone with that kind of schedule and so many obstacles could graduate high school but padrón did just that he credits his mother for helping him to not give up if i really wanted a future i d have to go to college he says of what she instilled but i had no idea how to go to college he said padrón looked to his high school counselor for guidance she told me i was not college material and that i should go to trade school and become a carpenter or plumber padrón thanked her but he could not get his mother s voice out of his head he knew he needed to go to college so he used all of his savings to apply to the top universities in the country i was overly ambitious he says with humor in his voice i applied to all these top universities thinking i d have a chance that spirit of ambition would pay off later for padrón in the meantime the college rejection letters poured in and eventually equaled the number of applications he had spent his savings to send he would never get to college at least that would be the story if community colleges didn t exist i learned that there was this school that had just opened recently padrón said of the renewed hope he was given after his rejections it was called dade county junior college at the time  community college was the difference for padrón the community college experience was transformative it was like i was born again there were all these people who took interest in me padrón says of why the experience was so life changing they helped me fill out my application helped me register and helped me understand what college was all about padrón also found that same support with the faculty at the institution after community college i went to several other universities and i never found the quality of faculty that i found at dade county junior college padrón also connected with students at the college who had similar backgrounds we formed a support group he says of their friendship he laughed as he described how only one friend had a car and how every morning eight of them would pile into it and drive to college and then wait around until the last friend had finished the last class they gave me a sense of belonging a sense of purpose and a renewed confidence padrón says of the support he received in college that confidence took padrón all the way to a phd in economics from the university of florida after having graduated summa cum laude from florida atlantic university he then began fielding job offers from the top companies around the country after living a life of poverty padrón jokes when people asked me what i wanted to do growing up i simply said i want to be rich after accepting a job offer from dupont university padrón paid a visit to miami to tell one of his community college professors the great news his professor said what do you mean you re going to join the corporate monster we were hoping you d come back here and pay your dues he gave me an incredible guilt trip padrón says of the encounter and it worked i told dupont that i was going to take a year and teach economics at the college and would then be back if the offer still stood i was only going to teach for a year but padrón never returned to dupont halfway through that year of teaching i knew that s what i wanted to do the rest of my life padrón said of this defining decision in his life teaching reminded me of my beginnings i saw people of all ages who knew that the only chance they had to achieve the american dream was being in that classroom padrón spent the rest of his career making a difference in students lives and is now president of the institution that gave him his start now called miami dade college i never became rich he says of his career decision but i am the richest guy you ll ever meet it is such a privilege to work at a place that changes students lives  http latinofoxnewscom latino community 20121008 hispanicheritagemonthme  fox news latino  ',0);

go very far on any of the five campuses of valencia college in central florida to hear what they are the communitycollege president s vision has seeped into the bloodstream of the orlando education community deans faculty tutors neighboring colleges and even employers it may seem odd to hear the same phrases pop up in conversations with various school administrators the ecosystem of higher education for example or anyone can learn anything under the right conditions until you meet shugart he has planted and cultivated those seeds in everyone around him what i m after there is not compliance what i m after there is fertility fecundity he said so a guy who s mowing the lawn can say you know what it s really not very learningcentered for me to mow right up next to the classrooms when people are trying to learn i need to mow away from the buildings during prime time if shugart sounds like a daytime talkshow host it s no accident he compares himself to phil donahue i have the same hair a more apt comparison is to former president clinton both leaders have an uncanny ability to make platitudinous statements sound genuine both relate easily to people and yes both have great hair from the very first year sandy was here he asked two questions are students learning how do we know said nasser hedayat a former electricalengineering professor who heads the college s outreach to orlando employers the answers to shugart s questions are the reason that valencia was the first school to win the top prize in the aspen institute s college excellence program the contest which offers 1 million a year for community colleges was unveiled two years ago by president obama when he launched a campaign to increase communitycollege graduations by a total of 5 million by 2020 one year later aspen awarded valencia 600000 and gave four runnerup institutions 100000 each valencia devoted more than half of its award 350000 to its unique facultytraining facility the rest went to student scholarships school fundraisers say that a matching campaign will at least double the amount of the aspen award the recognition that goes with the prize also upped shugart s national profile a few minutes before his interview with national journal  he finished a conference call with white house officials and three university presidents who sat on a panel that took place monday shugart thinks of himself as a risk taker he doesn t like to keep the college s funds in a trust account if he can spend the money on programs that bolster student learning he is critical of obama s college completion agenda because he believes it takes emphasis away from what really matters students learning staff members say that having shugart at the helm encourages them to take risks as well everyone calls him sandy he refuses to follow anyone s script which makes him both sought after and slightly feared as a public speaker a few years ago he removed his name from a list of potential speakers at a hearing of the senate health education labor and pensions committee after what he described as an awkward conversation with committee staffers he told them that pell grants don t affect students decisions about where to go to college i m on panels i make people angry i don t mean to he said what is college for  shugart is in the forefront of a national conversation that challenges the traditional romantic notions of college as in brick and ivy latenight study sessions fraternity pranks students hellbent on changing the world shugart is fond of pointing out that only 17 percent of college students fit this sentimental stereotype going to school full time living on campus completing a fouryear degree at one institution community colleges aren t yale or stanford they cater to the mundane parts of the college experience that don t show up in the movies their aim is to quickly and efficiently give students the skills they need to get a job with a decent salary they train people for stable careers in accounting electronics nursing and information technology their administrators use words like competencies we re really talking about people on the margins and institutions that have long been on the margins of higher education said joshua wyner who runs the aspen contest these marginal students are the target of obama s lofty goal to double college completions by 2020 agrade students don t need a white house initiative to pull together a college application cgrade students might they are the kids who can t get into fouryear colleges and probably can t afford them anyway they might have children and parttime jobs they usually need some kind of remediation or developmental education noncredit classes that teach them what they were supposed to have learned in high school if they make it to college at all odds are they won t finish almost half of the students who enter a community college either fail to get a degree or transfer to a fouryear school after six years according to the american association of community colleges this is a problem because high school diplomas are no longer going to cut it for americans who want to make a middleclass salary new research from the georgetown public policy institute predicts that by 2020 two of three jobs will require at least some college education that figure already hovers around 60 percent but there is good news as well there are 11 million middle jobs available for people who can t afford or simply can t deal with a full four years of college according to the report these are jobs that pay at least 50000 annually and require some posthighschool education but not a bachelor s degree jobs that reduce poverty rates and expand the economy the standard narratives about college must change to accommodate the students who will fill the middle jobs finishing has to be the ultimate goal not finding yourself students can t waste time and precious credit hours trying out several majors when i was in college the idea was that your freshman and sophomore years was an exploratory time totally gone it is not exploratory said joyce romano valencia s vice president for student services decide when you re in the womb what you want to do that thinking is controversial something precious is lost if colleges focus only on employment outcomes last year the pew research center found that americans even college presidents have conflicting views about higher education pew surveyed the general public and college presidents separately in each group half of the respondents said that the main purpose of college was to give students skills for the workplace the other half said it should focus on intellectual growth and critical thinking community colleges are at the heart of this tension they need to make a clearcut business case to prospective students who probably don t worry very much about the great books valencia s advisers tell high school students that they can double their incomes with a twoyear degree the college has attracted national attention for its betterthanaverage rate in awarding diplomas to people who otherwise might be running concession stands at one of orlando s theme parks valencia s overall graduation rate is nearly three times the average among large urban public community colleges as defined by the education department but it is also important for community colleges to provide an atmosphere in which students are encouraged to think it helps to have a charismatic leader like shugart but even then figuring out what that secret sauce is and then bottling it for mass consumption has proven to be a challenge big ideas with shugart as its talisman valencia openly challenges unspoken rules that permeate highereducation circles many community colleges depend on their enrollment income to balance their budgets valencia sacrifices its enrollment numbers and the accompanying dollars by turning students away who fail to register before the first day of a class research shows that students who register late are more likely to drop out so shugart says it makes sense to head those students off valencia also doesn t separate student services from academics which elevates the status of the dean of students but also runs the risk of deflating professorial egos the school has made its system work by devoting staff resources to each academic program faculty members are expected to participate in plotting their students graduation paths but each program also has an embedded fulltime career adviser to track students progress the most important of valencia s innovations is the hardest to export it s also hard to explain administrators frequently use the word culture when trying to describe it here s how it developed shugart interviewed for the president s job 12 years ago because he says he saw the opportunity to invert the prevailing theory of the 1990s namely that students are underprepared and unmotivated and don t know what s best for them we came to a different conclusion he said we said if we look carefully at our learners we don t think that there s anything inherently wrong with them that conclusion led to the six big ideas that have both impressed and confounded observers who want to replicate valencia s successes elsewhere the big ideas resemble chapter headings from a selfhelp book 1 anyone can learn anything under the right conditions 2 start right 3 connection and direction 4 the college is how the students experience us not how we experience them 5 the purpose of assessment is to improve learning 6 collaboration every day we step back and say what are students experiencing what do we want them to experience shugart said like most community colleges valencia has open enrollment it doesn t reject people because they failed algebra or even because they lack a permanent address shugart has made it clear that student success is everybody s job so there is a heavy emphasis on teaching and experimenting with new methods tenuretrack faculty members are required to complete a threeyear learning academy in which they invent and test theories about how to improve student learning adjunct faculty members who make up about twothirds of the teachers at valencia get a bump in pay if they participate in the same teacherdevelopment courses the college has thousands of class offerings but it invests most heavily in 15 to 20 gateway courses that make up 40 percent of the curriculum for firstyear students if students pass those courses they have a far better chance of finishing their degrees if they don t they re probably sunk the college is banking on success in those early classes to cascade into moreadvanced classes where students need less handholding and teachers need fewer resources all students are expected to map out a graduation plan in their first semester they must connect with faculty members career advisers tutors and studentservices staffers tutors usually students themselves know the professors personally and often sit in on classes to seek out students who might feel shy about asking for help tutoring centers are located in central campus areas and they are packed valencia constantly parses studentachievement data but the school does not tie faculty evaluations to those assessments the analyses don t even identify individual instructors this is a unique way to use assessments and it runs counter to educationreform efforts pushed by obama and others who want student test scores to be factored into teacher evaluations faculty evaluations at valencia are still weighted heavily toward teaching but they focus on the instructor s actions to engage students rather than test results how has the instructor measured his own progress has she taken student outcomes seriously in her experiments with teaching methods the teaching academy allows the school to document instructors progress as they develop their own teaching portfolios the accountability is not external the accountability is internal said kurt ewen valencia s assistant vice president of assessments after a few gorounds of instructorblind testing he said the reachers actually came to him to find out how their students were doing shugart is a big fan of consensus but he says committees are bad he is fond of calling 200 people into structured meetings that smack heavily of group therapy he splits them into smaller groups they analyze specific questions and make recommendations after a set time they reconvene refine their questions and repeat the smallgroup sessions at the end shugart takes a wireless microphone and walks among the groups à la phil donahue you seek dissent who really disagrees with this tell me why it s a technique designed to reach a strong set of ideas in consensus that are actionable in two and a half hours instead of two and a half years of committees he said given these unusual methods valencia administrators have a tough time explaining to outsiders how they work the aspen prize committee puzzled over the magic ingredients of the school s success they would say so we see these numbers where you have these many students graduating now or this kind of success what do you attribute that to ewen said behind the question was what specific strategies can another school employ that would get the same results as you and the answer is there are none fifty people met with the committee and to a person they would come out of the meeting saying they keep asking me that s all good but exactly what is making the difference here recalls romano the student services vice president they left and we thought ok well there s no way we re going to win because they obviously are looking for something more tangible the aspen judges were tough on valencia in part because the big ideas that guide the school can easily be dismissed as new age mumbo jumbo anyone can say that enrollment numbers are less important than learning but shugart showed he meant it when he stopped distributing enrollment reports to the faculty that was transformational aspen s wyner said you re saying as a new president i m having you do things that will literally sink the ship i m willing to bet my presidency on this don t add classes on the first day take away enrollment reports and students are still here  collaborate don t compete collaboration in the community is where valencia turns freeenterprise notions of competition on their head the colleges in the orlando area openly avoid competing with one another for students three colleges collectively agreed that valencia should be the one to offer a degree requested by defense contractor northrop grumman because valencia already had the most advanced electricalengineering curriculum the other two agreed to opt out valencia in turn offers only a few bachelor s degrees ones not offered by the university of central florida the behemoth fouryear university that is a distant goal for many of the state s highschool students why duplicate when you can supplement shugart reasoned valencia s most potent weapon to attract students is the chance for a direct path to ucf the university guarantees that those with an associate s degree from valencia or three other community colleges can come in as juniors the program dubbed direct connect appeals to students who may have difficulty getting into or paying for ucf state budget cuts forced ucf to increase tuition by 15 percent this year and its admissions policies have also gotten more selective over time the average sat scores for incoming freshmen have jumped 77 points in 10 years direct connect is the game changer that has altered the value of the twoyear college in the minds of students and parents all parents want their child to have a bachelor s degree a fouryear degree well in a sense the career path with the associate s degree can give them that said joan tiller who runs special projects for valencia shugart and ucf president john hitt collaborated on direct connect in 2005 the two presidents recruited the three other community colleges to hash out course work and other details that would give students a smooth transition to the fouryear university the negotiations required a high level of trust from ucf it took on an obligation to smaller colleges that don t turn people away and offer a lot of remedial courses the community colleges took on the job of making sure their graduates showed up at the university prepared to be juniors we all have drunk the same water and believe that we can do more together than we can do competing against one another it sounds like mom and apple pie but it really is true said ucf provost tony waldrop the university has advisory offices on all the communitycollege campuses served by direct connect and all the staff advisers are in constant contact students in valencia s elite honors program are automatically enrolled in ucf s honors program and the university periodically offers free football tickets to communitycollege students it can be difficult for some students or their parents to accept that they will spend their first college years on a campus that offers more technical certificates than studentlife activities romano said that it drives her crazy when students transfer to ucf before finishing all of their prerequisites the university s courses are more expensive and students who leave prematurely risk running out of financial aid still romano understands the yearning to move beyond an uberpractical community college for a bigtime university it s a big campus they have a greek life she said they have a bar in the student center added valencia s academic dean nick bekas valencia is not alone in telling highschool students that there are easier and cheaper ways to get to the fouryear university than through a grueling senioryear application process a recent report from the national student clearinghouse found that 45 percent of all students who completed a degree at a fouryear institution in 201011 had previously enrolled at a twoyear institution it s important for students to understand that there are multiple paths to success they don t have to cinch that same degree in three years said doug shapiro the clearinghouse s executive director of research degrees for employers valencia offers a handson jobtraining college experience that flouts the traditional classroom picture students in the school s culinary lab wear chef s uniforms and trace frosting designs on cookie sheets officials are proud that their culinaryarts degree is a fraction of the cost of the same degree at a private academy students in an invasivecardiology class are decked out in full hospital gear they practice threading guide wires through tiny catheter tubes and injecting dye the object is to get the dye into the tube without air bubbles which requires a steady hand when a bubble gets injected you can stroke the patient said student nalini ghisiawan the program had a 100 percent jobplacement rate last year the business community in central florida is so closely interwoven with the area colleges that it is sometimes difficult to distinguish the two in august valencia opened a satellite campus in lake nona medical city a planned cluster of hospitals and medicalresearch institutions once a cow pasture the hub also houses a campus for the university of central florida s medical school a veterans administration facility and a cuttingedge children s hospital valencia was involved in the lake nona planning from the beginning the goal was to create a friendly environment for sciencerelated companies and to build on orlando s lucrative tourism industry city officials hope that the area will become a mecca for medical conferences an international airport is nearby the presence of seaworld universal studios and disney world ensures plenty of hotel space valencia tries to craft its degrees to what employers need the college doubled its nursing program to respond to a shortage at florida hospital which ponied up 1 million for the expansion the hospital donated equipment and the school made sure that the students were trained on it shugart recalled the conversation that hatched the deal around a boardroom table of hospital and college executives florida hospital president lars houmann said he expected to spend 24 million a year to recruit and hire 1000 nurses ad infinitum i said well from what you re telling me i need to produce another 300 nurses a year to save you 12 million is that worth a million to you it s a business proposition shugart said cozy relationships between educators and employers can backfire if the market suddenly changes of course that s what happened with northrop grumman which asked valencia in 2006 to develop a laserphotonics program that would cater to its needs at the time the defense contractor was scrambling for workers to build the laserguided missile components and scanning equipment that the military was screaming for massive defensespending cuts suddenly dried up that demand last year northrop grumman laid off 200 employees some of them graduates of valencia s program the layoffs caused enough of a disturbance that the white house shied away from including valencia s laserphotonics program in one of president obama s speeches promoting college employer relationships more broadly critics say that aligning academic programs so closely with employers needs does a disservice to students who need a broader education they may be thinking of people like vik cesalien who interned at northrop grumman as part of a high school program dedicated to laser photonics cesalien is going for his bachelor s degree in lasers and electronics and he wants to work at northrop grumman the only trouble is the giant contractor isn t hiring a narrow focus on one company misses the point a host of other orlando employers were involved in crafting valencia s laserphotonics program but they didn t get as much publicity because they didn t write the biggest checks and they didn t have as dire a need for workers but the program is still going strong with contributions from a variety of employers including northrop grumman they re great they re still on the advisory committee they still started it when their contracts come back they ll hire people shugart said if the people we trained got laid off that s still ok with me because skills are a durable transferable fungible asset a certificate in laser photonics may not get someone a job at northrop grumman but it can allow him to design theme parks instead of just operating the rides that s what happened to jimmy hurst a technician at universal studios who spent the last year putting together graphic displays for the new harry potter theme park he was already working at universal when he decided to get an associate s degree from valencia without it he would have been stuck in a deadend job he tells his younger colleagues that a professional degree is their ticket to advancement they ll hire you as a technician but that s as far as you re going to go without it he said this is the story that valencia is trying to tell in a hundred different ways college is for everyone college doesn t have to be four years of book learning transfers are ok parttime school is fine twoyear degrees aren t terminal employers want degree holders who are from the area and valencia can offer them shugart is lucky that he operates in an environment friendly to his offthewall ideas he once considered inserting 5 bills into required textbooks to encourage students to buy early not every college has resources to freeze tuition as valencia did this year not every college has employees who would accept the accompanying wage freeze without complaint not every college is nestled in the heart of a booming health care and tourism region that is willing to support it not every college can do what valencia does that s kind of the point and if middleclass employment is going to continue into the next generation there should be more places like it national journal  ',0);
